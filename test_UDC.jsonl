{"conversations": ["im starting school this week and we are going to lerarn to program... i so need a easier a way to make the <> symbols then copy-paste method. any idea how i can maybe.. link a button the the symbols?", "... do you have keyboard issues?even the most standard 'us' keyboard layout should have them, and I don't think any other layout is missing them either...silly question, what about using the 'us' layout? :)so, have you tried the 'us' keyboard layout? I know it is not the same, but I suspect it might work.with us, it won't be on the key its printed on... have you tried literally all keys? :)is your keyboard smaller than standard? some mini laptop thing? :)can't see anything on that picture, tbh. its some highly blurred photograph of a screen, but there's no keyboard?I see. Thanks. Well, this is very regular position for these keys. I'd in fact expect it to work... suggestion, could you try a standard non-x console (ctrl-alt-f1 for instance, come back with f7 or f5)ah ha. so its just an x issue.should make us both happy since that at least means that hardware wise nothing is wired up in an odd way in your keyboard. some ppl aren't so lucky. :Pso... next. how have you actually tried to manipulate the keyboard layout so far? kde's selection dialog? xorg's config? a hal fdi file?... you have, according to what I heard earlier you somehow set this to us under xorg before? what exactly did you try there?so you just used some gui selection thingie? :)okay. just to make absolutely sure, open a console. type 'xev'. hit the > key as it would be printed on your keyboard. tell me the 'keysym' number it outputs when you do press it.I'd expect it to be 0x3c - that's 3c. :)wait, silly me is looking at the wrong number in xev. gimme a sec.what's the keycode?and that's really the key with a '<' printed on it? :/...its not what I expected. I wonder if the keyboard model affects the key code. Otherwise I'm at a loss for an explanation why it works in the console.i mean in ctrl-alt-f1's console...you said it worked there, earlier?ah, then I must have misunderstood you before.yep... you know, this ain't easy, but lets try this: xmodmap -e 'keycode 51 = 0x3c'yep. if that doesn't work, perhaps 43 instead of 51 worksand btw, me telling you this is more or less of a little resignation to get this resolved in a non-xmodmappy way. I do think your hardware is non-standard by now. xDyes... we need to add another number for greater than and the last symbolThey'll come after 0x3c, space delimited. now, I, being ingeniously silly again, have done this here myself and lost the number so I'll have to google 'em or reboot :Pxmodmap -e 'keycode 94 = 0x3c 0x3e 0x7c' this looks like its like your keyboardtell me if I got the right alt modifier wrong...now ... fn, I can't test. but normal and shift should work 'swell... I don't see the star key on your photograph?Is that also a modifier key in norwegian layouts, like shift?ah, duh, I gave you a command with MY key :Pxmodmap -e 'keycode 94 = 0x3c 0x3e 0x7c' <- this should have had 51 instead of 94... but you copy and pasted it right?there. also try alt-gr. I should have made it | ...duh. I thought that was printed on that key from the screenshot. ahwell. its the third 0x7c number, you can probably omit it thenThese 'magic' numbers are ascii key codes btw in hex notation. Now, just save this in a text file somewhere.Yes, but you can auto-run this command on startup of your window manager.about that... it requires the key code for a , and the corresponding code for the symbol is 0x2A . It is probably the fith number after the equals sign in the xmodmap command.but I don't currently know what the first four would be tho... :)actually I know the first two I guess. 0x61 and 0x41 for 'a' and 'A'xmodmap -e 'keycode 94 = 0x61 0x41 0x61 0x61 0x2a' substitute the right key code from xev and I guess you're good to go. I just filled the two modifier keys a variants I don't know about with a small 'a'I bet by now you get the drill. Suggestion, write down in the config file how you do this, just in case the next xorg remaps it again or something.add it to the wm / de specific startup script, or the standard ~/.xmodmap file. xmodmap doesn't take the entire 'command', but rather has lines like 'keycode 57 = 0x31 0x33' - one line per key codethe second xmodmap was meant to be ~/.xmodmap btw. A file rather than the command we just used.I think you might need to create it with a text editor.Or perhaps someone else can help you with adding the full command to your wm's startup files.
