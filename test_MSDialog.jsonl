Melindafter installing the final release version (15.11.2) yesterday, I can no longer open documents from Finder or SharePoint. Documents opened using File - Open in Word open as expected. If I double-click a Word document in Finder, the Word application launches, but the document doesn't open. Clicking the Window menu confirms that no documents are open. Dragging the document onto the Word icon in the Dock doesn't work either, nor does the \"Edit in Word\" option in the SharePoint web interface. AMelindanyone else seeing this? Is there a workaround? Incidentally, I tried Excel and it works fine.. It appears that I can't save in Word either -- clicking File - Save Melindas... results in the Save and Save AMelindas... items being greyed out in the menu, but the save dialog box never appears. It seems that my installation of Word is messed up badly. I tried re-installing on top using the 15.11.2 installer, but no change. Looking into how to uninstall Office 2016 now.. I've tried moving Word to the trash and re-installing using the Office 2016 Mac 15.11.2 installer, but I get the same behaviour. Melindanyone know what else I need to delete to get back to a \"fresh\" install of Word?", "I also have this problem - as far as I can see Word thinks (correctly) that it is licensed when it first opens, then decides it isn't when you double click on the file in the finder. Or something like this... it certainly starts to have 'activate office' in the menu & won't create new documents. Melindas far as I can see Excel, Word, Outlook and Onenote do not have this problem. It also wasn't a problem on the previous beta. I have tried the script that resets the licensing system, and also a full delete of office 2016 & re-install (both as described on the microsoft support site), but it hasn't fixed it. It's not clear if we can do anything about this until Microsoft fix their error - I'm seeing it mentioned in other discussions, so it seems to be quite widespread. It might be associated with running the beta - I've also still got Office 2011 on my Mac.", "Interesting -- I noticed that there is a \"Sign Out...\" entry in the \"Word\" menu -- if I click it I am prompted to confirm, but nothing seems to happen, and no \"Sign In...\" item appears in its place. If I close and re-open Word, I'm not prompted to sign in. For me, it seems that signing into OneNote causes Word to be signed in. Unfortunately, none of this helps in addressing the aforementioned problems.", "I have the same problems reported here. Weirdly, all other Office for Mac 2016 apps (PowerPoint, Excel, etc) seem to work fine. Only Word has this frustrating issue where it spontaneously deactivates itself when you try to save and doesn't present a Sign In... or Sign Out... option on the File menu. Like others, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but that didn't fix the problem. But get this--when I switch to a different account (on the same laptop) than I used to install Office, Word works just fine after I sign in with the credentials for my Office 365 Family account. So the problem seems to be one specific to a user profile. Which makes me wonder whether it could be fixed by finding and deleting the license files for Office in ~/Library, thus forcing Word to recreate them. I'm not sure where to look for these, though. Melindanyone know? AMelindand Microsoft, if you're listening--please issue an update to fix this crippling issue AMelindaSAMelindaP!. There are lots of reports about this issue, it's a bug. Try using File>Open from within Word until they fix this.. Melindall of the symptoms you described cleared up after I \"deactivated\" my previous install via and then reactivated within Word. If you're using two-factor authentication, you may also need to turn this off, then turn it on again (regenerating back-up codes) and then also request an app password.. No, didn't work. The funny thing is that when word is opened the 'word' menu has the option to activate, I click that, there is a short pause & then the 'word menu' looks fine, click on the 'File' menu - looks fine, click back on the Word menu, and 'activate' is there again, click back on 'File' menu and 'New document' 'New from template' etc are all greyed out. - update, another try: Close word, then reopen it - fine; click on file menu once - looks fine, click a second time - greyed out options. I tried ZacharySolo's approach and it worked great! Thanks, KenRobert. it's working!!!!. This worked for me as well! FWIW, I was a beta test for Office 2016 so I attributed this issue to that..

{"conversations": ["Microsoft Security Essentials Scheduled Scan Never Runs. [SEP] I recently installed Microsoft Security Essentials Version 1.0.1611.0 and have not been able to get a scheduled scan to run. I scheduled a weekly scan with all the default options on the settings tabs, but the scan never runs, even after my PC has been left idle for long periods of time. The only observation I have noted is that the task created by the program in Task Scheduler shows a status of Queued when the time and idle conditions have been met. It seems to be related to the idle constraint on the conditions tab in Task Scheduler, with this condition unchecked the task does run as expected. OS Version: Windows 7 RC", "Since MSE does not show any history of a scan unless it found an infection, how are you confirming that it never runs? There are a few other discussions here about the fact that scans can start way before and way after the scheduled time. And, if the PC is off or asleep when the scheduled scan should run, it does not then run at wake - it is simply skipped. -steve Microsoft MVP Windows Live / Windows Live OneCare, Live Mesh, & MS Security Essentials Forums Moderator. It is possible that some other program on your machine is preventing the OS to enter the idle state. Unfortunately, the Idle behavior is owned by Windows, so there isn't much we can do about that. Another common problem is scheduling the scan at night but turning off your computer every night. In your scenario I'd recommend turning off the idle setting in the MSE configuration. Doing this will cause MSE to schedule the scan itself, instead of using the Task Scheduler. For future reference, you can verify whether or not your scheduled scans ran by opening Event Viewer (eventvwr). You can look for MSE events in Windows Logs->System. Joseph Toole - Microsoft Antimalware - This post is provideJulied as-is with no warranty or support.", "I know it never runs because the status of the scan job in Task Scheduler changes from Ready to Queued after the scheduled time and remains that way indefinitely, the Last Run Time always says Never. Also, MSE creates scan has started/finished entries in the system event log, I have verified that the scheduled scans have never run by checking Event Viewer. The settings tab only allows you to choose an hour \"around\" which to run the scan, not a precise time, so I understand why there are discussions about that. I believe MS randomized the scheduled times to more evenly distribute the load on their servers when MSE downloads the latest definitions before each scan. The fact that scans are missed when the PC is off or asleep is not an MSE issue, it's a Task Scheduler issue. Task Scheduler won't run a task if the PC if off at the scheduled time, it has always worked that way in all versions of Windows from my experience. MS should add an option to have a task run the next time the computer is turned on if the scheduled time is missed to solve that problem, I've seen this in other scheduling software..

I have another spreadsheet containing three columns with telephone numbers in - de-dupe list. I want to highlight any telephone numbers that appear in any of the three columns in database, that also appear in de-dupe list, so I can ultimately delete the rows that these numbers feature in. The telephone number might be in the first column in database, but the second or third in de-dupe list. Is there a way to do this in Excel? I am currently combining the three telephone number columns in the de-dupe list into one column (manually) and running a seperate vlookup for each telephone number column in the database against this, but there are large volumes of data and this isn't ideal. Any advice appreciated!", "Well, I have two improvements (may not be \"solutions\") depending on what you are trying to do. When you are searching one list for a match to another list, Vlookup takes more system resources than \"Match.\" So once you have your combined list you can do \"=match(A1,C:C,0)\" instead of \"=vlookup(A1, C:C,1,false)\" since all you are looking for is a yes/no answer, not the actual data. You will get an \"Err\" instead of an \"N/A\" from match when there is no match, but it will still make your computer happier. But I suspect that you are using extra steps, where does your \"De-dupe\" list come from? If your original list has duplicates in it, meaning multiple rows with the same (in this case) phone numbers, there is an easy trick to quickly find duplicate values. Select the row with the phone numbers in it, go to the home tab at the top, click \"Conditional Formatting,\" then choose \"Highlight Cells rules,\" and \"Duplicate Values.\" Then remove your duplicates and remove your conditional formatting (conditional formatting is a horrible resource drain, so should be deleted when possible). If I had more info I might be able to give you a better solution, sorry.. You can use conditional formatting to highlight the cells that have matching telephone numbers. This is assuming that you want to highlight the cells in your de-dupe list worksheet that also appear on your database worksheet. Also assuming the columns are A, B, and C. In cell A2, insert this conditional formatting rule: =COUNTIF(database!$A:$C,A2)>0 then pick the cell color you want to apply. Then copy and paste special...formats cell A1 to all of columns A, B, and C. This will highlight the cells that have matching numbers on database worksheet. HTH", "Hi - the match formula vs vlookup is a good tip thank you! My database is one spreadsheet and my de-dupe list is another spreadsheet - both contain three columns of telephone numbers.

It's the standard 44 bytes that every .cda shows as, it's in my file explorer but I can't find a file converter that will recognize it. It won't play with iTunes or Windows Media( as is expected) but it WILL play with VLC Media Player. If there are any suggestions I'd love to hear them.", "This article will give a comprehensive understanding on CDA file, along with three surefire ways for converting CDA files to MP3. when you play audio CD on your computer, you will see that each track is labeled as “Track##.CDA”. However, CDA is actually not a file format nor it contains any information at all. CDA stands for Compact Disk Audio, it represents a shortcut of audio track from a Windows perspective. In reality, it does not have any music file in it but only track time and length. This is the main reason why copying an audio CD into your computer and playing it afterwards without the CD will return CDA playback error. Luckily, you can still copy the sound tracks in a CD by converting CDA files into popular audio formats such as MP3. Though, extracting the actual music content and transforming it into a playable format is deemed to be impossible without the help of CDA file to MP3 converter. Discover these helpful tools after the jump. For those who need a powerful tool that can do more than just extracting audio CDs, Streaming Audio Recorder is what you need best. This software is packed with amazing features. It can convert audio CDs turning them into popular formats such as MP3, WAV, WMA, OGG, AAC and FLAC. Aside from this, you can also record any sound on your computer in a stunning 1:1 quality. Downloading music files from video streaming sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, YouTube and all others is also possible. Even more, there is a built-in ID3 tag identifier as well as editing tool included so you can easily cut, copy, merge, split, and create your own sound that later can be burned into a CD. Using it is a breeze: Without even spending a dime, FreeRIP MP3 converter allows users to rip CD contents and convert them into different audio formats such as WMA, MP3, Ogg, Wav or FLAC for future device playback. Besides, it comes packed with many other features. For example, it can convert existing MP3 files into other file formats and editing MP3 tags is equally possible which makes cataloging your entire collection simple and easy. Additionally, you can also burn audio CDs, load album artwork, search appropriate music info and all others while retaining the richness of your sound. But keep in mind that you can’t use it for any commercial purposes. To use it, all you need to do is: Once you have saved the CDA files in your preferred MP3 format, it’s easy for you to transfer them to your portable audio player such as iPod, Creative Zen player, Zun, etc. iTunes is a popular media player and organizer made by Apple to meet the increasing demands of portable music. Aside from being a player and library, converting CDA files to MP3 is also possible with iTunes. No changes would be made into the software thus allowing you to transform unrecognized files into playable formats without getting ripped. Yes, this service from iTunes is totally free. See below on how to convert", "Ok, maybe I didn't describe the situation well enough. I am fully aware how .cda files work and how to deal with them from an audio CD.

When she needed to access a file she merely clicked on the OneDrive folder in Windows Explorer and off she went. Recently someone told her that because of the new Windows 10 built-in OneDrive UWP app, she needed to ditch the \"old\" OneDrive so she uninstalled it and began to try to try and transition over to the new OneDrive UWP, first via a shortcut on her Taskbar (put there from the standard Windows Programs List) and then later (after she had untold problems) directly from the link in her Edge browser via the MSN Home Page, where's there's an icon for it. Bottom line is that she's totally lost, especially since there does not seem to be a functioning OneDrive UWP folder on her hard drive that she can immediately access (like with the old OneDrive) which also kept all her files in sync (it's really her boss's account that she's signed into, so she can update files that he's uploaded to the Cloud). She's also had to add the new OneDrive account to her Office 2016 Home & Business suite (this is the desktop version, not Office 365, by the way) which she didn't want to do. With the old app she could just click on a (\"physical\", if you will) folder and not have to be logged onto a Microsoft Web account. So, is there any way to cause the new OneDrive UWP app to create some kind of \"virtual folder\" on her hard drive or in Windows Explorer such that she could access it like she did the other one? Also she wants to add the new OneDrive to the \"Send To\" menu (so she can send a file directly to OneDrive by right-clicking it) but since there does not appear to be an actual physical folder any more, I can't figure out how to accomplish that. There are instructions on how to do that with the old OneDrive but not the new one because again, there does not seem to be a \"new\" OneDrive folder to navigate to in order to set it up. And finally, is there some comprehensive guide or tutorial on exactly how to best set-up and utilize the new OneDrive UWP app in general?

[SEP] We have several corporate wide Word templates developed in Word 2007/2010 in which the Fluent Ribbon was customized with a Tab with specific functions to a Word template.

That said, I just checked 8 of my add-ins that have ribbon and QAT modifications (through xml) and they all work fine in Word 2016. Do your templates modify the ribbon using code rather than by modifications to the xml of the template?", "I've contacted someone on the Windows 10 team with a local installation of Office to try to open the template in safe mode..

Hi Kimberly, I'm updating this thread with what has happened since you sent me the template and I've returned it privately to you. The first thing I did was to use the CustomUI Editor, which is available free from OpenXMLDeveloper.org.

Opening your template using the CustomUI Editor I was able to validate that your XML code for Word 2007 and the editor also allowed me to save a second version of the XML using the Word 2010 XML namespace. Now your template is able to run on ALL Windows versions of Office from 2007 thru 2016. If you are loading this custom template as a global add-in, meaning you are placing it into the Startup folder of Word then if you are still not seeing the custom tab when you start Word... that means Word has disabled it. You will have to clear that disablement before Word will allow the add-in to run again. There are two types of disablement... Soft and Hard. To remove a Soft disable... Word cannot be running at all in the system. Then start Word and goto File>Options>Add-ins and check if your add-in is listed in the Inactive list. Assuming it is, then at the bottom of the Add-ins dialog is a pull-down menu, which should say Com Add-ins and click the Go button. A new window will open, your Add-in should be listed and you need to Enable it. If Word has performed a Hard disable...

I hope this makes sense! Thanks. I realised my example didn't make sense with the originals, so I corrected it to the below. { { IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes1 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes2 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes3 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes4 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes5 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes6 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes7 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes8 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes9 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes9 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD scorrect } = \"0\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes10 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"1\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleno1 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"1\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleno2 } } { IF{MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = \"1\" { MERGEFIELD Doubleno3 }", "It is doing that because every IF field is in its own paragraph, and Word still displays/prints the paragraph mark.

[SEP] Hi, I'm wondering if something is wrong with my OneDrive account for the following reasons: I have a small OneDrive icon on my favorites bar in Internet Explorer on Windows 10 -- I do not use Edge -- and when I press it to open OneDrive a blank page appears except for a picture of an empty folder above the words: \"This folder is empty. Drag files here to upload them to OneDrive. You can also add files to this folder using the OneDrive app on your computer. \" On the upper left hand side of the webpage is the words \"Shared.\" Before I upgraded to Windows 10, about a week ago, OneDrive never opened to that page; instead, after pressing the icon, I would see all my files, and a left pane that said OneDrive, with a list below. That rarely, if ever, happens now with Windows 10. But what's even stranger and is making me wonder if there's a real problem is that when I arrive at the empty Shared page, I then press \"sign out,\" but instead of signing me out I'm then brought to the file page, which is what I used to see initially on Windows 8.

{"conversations": ["Excel email address hyperlinks - Alert - Cannot open specified file. [SEP] PROBLEM: I have email addresses in an Excel file (Mac 2016). When I click on them I get the alert - \"Cannot open specified file\" Does anyone know how to make proper clickable email links that will allow them to open up in my Mac Mail program? Not as critical, but I also have a column of website links that I'd like to turn into clickable links. They already have the proper http formatting. (for example) BACKGROUND NOTES: Initially I was copying and pasting the email addresses into Excel. At that point they were clickable. But the font formatting and font sizes were all over the place. So I selected the entire column and clicked Edit > Clear > Formats. This cleaned things up nicely. But the underline and blue text highlighting disappeared. I assumed that they were not clickable at that point (that is debatable now) so I found some forum thread that explained how to format them back as clickable emails. It's been weeks since I did it, but I think that I may have highlighted the column and clicked \"fn\" and \"F2\" at the same time. Could be wrong about that. After doing some more research I noticed that if I hover over the cell it shows an address that looks like this: file://///NoServer/*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for example). It should probably be mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for example) but I don't know how to fix them. Another weird thing to note is that I have some blank cells with no email address. They also kick back that alert \"Cannot open specified file\". And if I hover over the cell it shows. file://///NoServer/NoFolder", "Hi Yvette, First, I would like to explain that if you clear the format of the link or email address, the underline and blue text will be removed. However, you still can click the link or email address to open it. About the issue “Cannot open specified file”, I suggest you try the following steps to check if the issue still exists: 1. Right click the cell which is affected. 2. Select Edit Hyperlink. 3. Select Email Address. 4. Retype the address again as below: If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information? 1. The Office version and OS version. 2. Check if other files also have the issue. 3. The screenshot of Edit Hyperlink. 4. The screenshot of error message. Thanks, QingKristen", "Hi Kristen, Thanks for the reply! I was able to do as you suggested and manually added the \"mailto:\" part to the address and it opened right up in Mac Mail. Note that it defaults to opening up the edit hyperlink window with the \"Web Page or File\" tab selected, not the \"Email Address\" tab. I didn't realize that at first and simply added \"mailto:\" to the address field that reads \"Link to an existing file or web page.\". This worked though. When I click OK, test and then go back to the Edit window, the information updates and gets transferred to the correct \"Email Address\" tab. So that's good! I did notice that it shows the \"mailto:\" code in the actual cell of the worksheet instead of being hidden code. When I go back in to check the edit hyperlink window it shows \"Text to Display:\" with the \"mailto:\" code, but the actual \"Email address:\" field shows the email address without the \"mailto:\" code. I can go back in manually and remove that mailto:\" from the Text to Display field and it still works properly. This is how a brand new email being added looks like in the Edit Hyperlink window. There is no \"mailto:\" code in either field. So it must automatically add the proper code behind the scenes to function. Another thing to note is that when I go into one of the messed up emails and it opens automatically to the Web Page or File tab - the text to display field shows \" Email address is removed for privacy ***\" (for example). So that is probably what is causing the problem. So, my next question then... Is there a way to update multiple cells at one time?

Do you get an error message when it gets disconnected? What is the exact make and model of the computer? Are you referring to Dell inspiron 7000 or Dell inspiron 15 7000 series?

{"conversations": ["Need Help Fixing a Corrupted .WLMP File. [SEP] Hello, My wife was working on a Christmas Video of our sons to give out as presents. After days of work, she was almost finished with the project when the program started to freeze up on her. She was able to save her work before closing out the program but after restarting the computer, Movie Maker says that the file is either incompatible or corrupted. I know it is a compatible file since it had been working previously and that it must be corrupted since other .wlmp files still open. I have looked around and found several threads in which Ronald seems to really know what he is talking about with fixing these files. I tried to follow his advice found in this thread which describes looking at the file as an xml or in notepad and looking for missing information. I did this for both the text and music sections since that is what my wife had been working on at the time of the problem but it did not fix the file. I even removed all entries from the text and music sections to see if that would resolve the issues, but it did not help either. I tried chatting with the live tech support too, but both reps I spoke with had me disable all non-Microsoft services and restart the computer to see if anything was interfering with the program. I did this even though the program works just fine with other project files. One rep also had me run sfc /scannow because they said that would fix corrupted files. I'm fairly certain this only fixes Windows System files and not the corrupted project file I am trying to fix. I ran it anyways and it finished without finding any problems. I'm now just looking for anyone who can either look at the file for me and fix it or get me in direct contact with considerate_guyRonald since he really seems to know Movie Maker problems inside and out. Thanks in advance for any help you can send my way! -Tom", "I'll see if I can get in contact with that guy... Oh wait. That's me! I'm sorry about the generic \"help\" you got about disabling services and running sfc. Honestly given that Microsoft hasn't updated Movie Maker since 2012 and since they are planning to drop support next month, there is even less incentive for them to have experts on Movie Maker available to help. I'd have to see the actual project file to see if it can be put back into an editable state. Obviously with Christmas coming up my time is limited also, but I'll do my best to help out. Can you post a link to the .wlmp so I can take a look?", "Hello!!! I'm so glad to get in touch with you! Thanks for your quick reply too. Here is the link to the file.

It is hidden an shrunken to couple pixel icon, so it is impossible to hit on bus or even walking.. Ok, if I can't remove a contact, how do I disassociate Skype from my contact list on my phone. This has created a very serious issue for me as Skype has auto-associated business contacts of mine with Skype ID's I didn't even know they have and I could get fired by contacting them through Skype via my company policy.. Ok, If anybody else has this challenge, I did find a work around. I removed the application from my phone because it was too high risk for me.

In the top right hand corner in a faint white font it says \"SKIP\" I selected that and continued through the setup and now the only thing in my Skype is my Skype contacts. Don't know if it will stay that way, but it works for now. Good luck. Danida, I applause your positive nature given all the frustrations on this forum. Any chance you can point me to some documentation on some of the positive features of the new Skype?

I have contacted Microsoft Support 3 times to no avail. The problem is not that I want to allow the update to install 1 time, I AM NOT USING DEFENDER. I am using Norton Security and so Defender is turned off properly but the definition files are still pushed out through Update and then fail when installation is attempted. Since I am not going to be using Defender I need a solution that will not involve turning off my AV software, turning on Defender, installing the update (which there are sometimes multiple ones per day) and then turning Defender back off and turning my AV back on, which is what they have all done to \"fix\" the problem. I know Microsoft wants to push all updates but there needs to be a way for Update to check if Defender is on and then NOT TRY TO INSTALL THE UPDATE or let it be installed without needing Defender turned on so that there is no error. As it is now the error happens, Update states that it failed and will keep trying to install it later which will always fail. As I said I have dealt with 2 support engineers and 1 supervisor and all they have done after hours of trying to \"fix\" the problem is get the failed definition to install insisting that the problem is now fixed- they turn Norton off or uninstall it, turn Defender on, install the definitions then turn Defender back off and Norton back on or make me reinstall it. I am not going to do this multiple times each day. One engineer went so far as to say the problem is because Norton Security is *NOT* compatible with Windows 10 and went even further to say that because I am using it I now have viruses and corrupt files. I pushed back and he started backing down by suggesting it was his opinion that Norton doesn't work. I continued to press and ask whether this was officially Microsoft's position or not and he would not answer. I got Norton on the phone and he could hardly speak. Norton did what it should when installed- it properly turned off Defender and every indication is that is off. There is no reason to install definition updates when there is other active AV software and Defender is off. Why can't Microsoft supply a permanent way of \"fixing\" this issue???

Thank you.", "I just don't get it. To say \"also if you are using any third party security software on the computer then you may face issues with installing the Windows Defender update\" is totally unsatisfactory\" Norton Security is not causing a problem, Widows Update and Defender are. As it should, installing Norton turned off Defender yet MS is still pushing definition updates and trying to install them which they know will fail and generate errors. I have tried your suggestions as have the 3 support people I said I spoke to at MS to no avail. Can someone answer these questions: 1- Why must you try and install definition updates when Defender is off? 2- Or why don't you allow the files to be installed even if Defender is off? 3-Or if Defender is off why don't you just squelch the errors as it is NOT REALLY AN ERROR IT IS DESIGNED TO DO THAT? I am frustrated at Microsoft's responses so far. Does anyone out there know of a solution that has actually worked and not just for the one error shown as failing but stops the error from happening each time a new definition update is pushed? Thanks.", "I have absolutely the same situation. The problem occurred after installing Norton360 (ver. 22.5.5.15). Thus, the problem of incorrect work of Windows Update really exist. Moreover, the error 0x80070643 Windows Defender occurs in a significant number of users after the installation of third-party anti-virus applications. As the author of this topic, it seems to me that the Microsoft development team needs to find a valid fix this problem. Then Microsoft Support Engineers should not to forget to inform and please their users is very sad ;/(. And! The main question which should be answered here clearly: Is whether the problem will impede the proper installation of OS updates, and other Microsoft products, or will only be present as a constant irritating factor?", "I agree but from my discussions with the 3 Microsoft support people I would not expect anything. They all came up with excuses, not fixes. I reiterate that a simple fix exists- before the updates are installed check to see if Defender is on or off- clearly the system knows. If it is off there are several things that can be done such as installing the updates anyway as it would not cause any problems, discard the updates or just don't generate an error message as it works as designed and there is no action to be taken. But since Microsoft wants everyone to use their product they won't unless they get such a volume of complaints that they can't ignore it.", "That situation, which you have told, says that the problem at the moment have not an actual solution. Engineers from the Support Service does not create solutions - they act in accordance with the decisions and the approaches created a Team of Developers. It seems that this problem is not trivial. Otherwise, we quickly received a decision from the Support Service. But to find a complete solution to this problem, it is a matter of honor for Developers. Perhaps it will take even create a new version of the Windows Update. Anyway, I do not remember problems of this kind since the time Windows Millennium. It was not presented also in Windows XP and 7. In other words, this component of the Windows 10 requires further development and improvement. But at the moment it is much more important point - to get clear answer to a simple question: whether in this case might normally receive following upcoming updates of the OS and other Microsoft products, or we will not have this \"happiness\"? And, frankly, I am surprised at the lack of response on this direct question from Experts of this forum.. That is Norton problem not Microsoft, Norton must do better ,my advice d't use Norton use Bitdefender and You going to be OK.", "I don't know if you work for Microsoft or Bitdefender but you are flat out wrong. The problem is with Windows Update/Defender. Don't bother answering as I know of people who don't use Norton who have the same problem. If Defender is off the updates fail- that is how it is designed.", "I too have been experiencing this problem since I installed an updated version of Norton Deluxe this new year. I have repeatedly reported the issue, I uninstalled Norton, switched on Defender ran Winows Update, cleared the error and then switched defender off manually and reinstalled Norton. The error disappeared when I ran a subsequent Windows Update. Alas, when I switched on my PC this morning the same error message appeared in Windows Update, which was bloody frustrating. It is obviously an issue with Windows 10 programming which needs to be addressed and I've told them as much. Drake brought your thread to my attention so I can only assume 100,000's people must be experiencing the same problem because we aren't running Windows Defender like Microsoft would like us to do! For the record other updates are going through from Windows, I updated Flash Player via Windows Update with this error remaining after its installation.", "I have had 3 support techs try and tell me it is a problem with Norton. I proved to them that it wasn't and finally they stopped blaming Norton but all they did was what you and I did- turned off Norton or uninstalled it, turned on Defender so the update that failed would go through and tell me it was \"fixed\". Alas the nest definition update failed because I turned Norton back on and Defender off. As an ex-programmer the fix is so obvious it is clear that MS just wants to **** us off and get us to switch to Defender. I have used Norton since the late 1980's and will not switch to an inferior MS product. All they have to do is one of 3 things: 1- check if Defender is off and if it is don't try and install the update because it is designed to fail. 2- let the definition file be updated anyway if Defender is off as it will not harm anything. This way if I ever decide to turn Defender on I will have the most recent definitions. 3- check if Defender is off and don't download the updates because I don't need them. MS attitude sucks. I have been using Windows 10 now for 6 months and I am not impressed with it. It runs no faster then previous versions, I had to install additional memory because even though they said I had enough prior to installing I found that I was maxing out memory and there are no great benefits. I doubt they will do anything about this because they want to force everyone to use their products but if I was them I would not want my software to generate an error message when it works as designed.", "Hi, What is the make and model of your computer?

Thanks, Austin", "Austin, I have no idea which things to attempt on the linked page for troubleshooting sync errors in OneNote Mac. Don't know if it's notes, sections or what exactly is the root cause of the problem. (If I knew that...) When I uninstalled and reinstalled yesterday, I added a section before \"can't sync\" happened again so quickly after the reinstall. That section, created yesterday, appears in OneNote Online. I don't see any errors when I load the notebook. I am loading the notebook from OneDrive online. So... LangLinda", "Hi So much for the cloud, right? When you see a cryptic error code like 0xE0000063 it means that a programmer screwed up and didn't error trap the code. When you ask support people for help, they look this kind of error up in their database, and unless someone else came along and figured it out and entered the solution into the support database, they simply don't have a clue. Saving to the cloud introduces a whole new level of potential errors. Is it the connection? Is it the web browser? Is it the site? Is it a server database error? A good error message would tell you. This one tells you crap. Something you can try on your end is to reduce the chances that the error is due to your connection's DNS server. Try using a Google DNS server and see if that improves things. This is only one of many possible causes of the error, but trying this can rule out at least one of them. How to Use OpenDNS or Google DNS on Your Mac", "Nicholas, I guess I wasn't really paying attention to the errors... there was a line above the cryptic code about a specific note. I deleted that note to deleted notes folder. Then I got an error pointing at the same note in deleted notes. So I cleared deleted notes. Then I changed DNS to point at OpenDNS, then Google. Syncing was taking a very long time. I had noticed that the original DNS was originally pointing at 192.168.86.1, which is my Google Wifi router. By default, that uses the Google DNS servers. So I put that back as the sole DNS server and sync's occurred almost instantly. Ultimately, one guesses that there's a problem with the app that allows notes, sections, whatever, to become corrupted and, one further guesses, that corrupted notes/sections/whatever then prevent syncs from occurring. Does the corruption occur during syncs? No clue. I've moved my note taking duties over to Apple Notes. It's not nearly as powerful as OneNote, to be sure, but it allows me to create the equivalent of section groups with sections beneath. It requires a bit more management on my part, but so far, no sync problems using iCloud. I'll continue using OneNote, for now... parallel to Notes. But if the sync problems continue to occur, I will throw in the towel and give up on OneNote. imho, apps should \"just work\" and not require the end user to read through pages of TS docs to fix a cryptic problem. Thanks for your reply; much appreciated! LangLinda", "Hi Linda, Thanks for your reply.

{"conversations": ["Windows Surface Pro 3 Touchscreen Not Functioning Properly. [SEP] I have had my Surface Pro 3 since about late September/early October of 2015 (now April 2017), and have been enjoying many of its features. Over time, however, the touchscreen has slowly lost its functionality. It started with occasionally displaying feedback as if I was touching the screen (and holding my finger there for a moment to imitate a (right click) on the screen) in a specific spot (always the same spot, about 3 or 4 inches in from the top right corner, and maybe 1/2 inch from the top). Over time, this became more and more problematic, but still isn't generally a big deal. It mostly happens on the lock screen and goes away as soon as the screen is unlocked, which means nothing happens with it. Lately, it will do it in other windows (since I spend a lot of time in Google Chrome, I'm suddenly getting a ton of new bookmarks I don't want, but it happens in any app I use, such as Microsoft Office Word, Mahjong, Sudoku, Netflix, etc). Another new development is that about 95% (or more) of the time, the top 1.5 or 2 inches of the touchscreen do not work, at all. I have to use a mouse to use that top strip, which is do-able. I almost always have my type cover either plugged in or handy, or my surface pen, or my mouse, so this isn't necessarily the end of the world. I can also drag the top edge of the window down just far enough that I can touch the top of the window for any purpose (switching tabs, for example). On occasion, I will notice other sections of the screen not responding to touch, but usually this goes back to \"normal\" after a few seconds, or if I lock and unlock the screen. Very rarely, I will be able to use the full touchscreen, but for at least the last four months (quite possibly 6 or 7, but I can't remember for sure how long this issue has persisted) the top band is useless as a touch screen. Another new issue is that sometimes when I touch a text box, the on-screen keyboard doesn't pop up for us (primarily when I'm trying to unlock my screen and the number pad doesn't pop up, requiring me to plug in my type cover just to unlock the screen). Now, none of this (or the other specific issues that I'm forgetting) is something I can't live with. But, as I've noticed it getting worse and it's becoming more and more distracting (I spent a full 2.5 minutes removing a bookmark just to have it be made again, all while my mouse was nearly inaccessible because the screen thought I was holding the bookmark button before I decided to start troubleshooting my touchscreen issues again) I thought I should get to the bottom of it- sooner than later. It's beginning to interfere with my school work and all around productivity; I've spent hours troubleshooting, browsing", "Hi Renee, We're glad to know that everything is updated. However, if the touchscreen is not responding to touch input, we suggest that you check Device Manager for the status of Firmware > Surface Pro Touch Controller Firmware.

The device status for Surface Pro Touch Controller Firmware is \"This device is working properly\" and a scan for updates determined that the driver is up to date.

Also, I've had a few tech friends ask this question so I thought I'd clear this up: There is no cosmetic damage on my device.

Note that CWT is equal to the total pounds divided by 100. 0-1710 lbs = $7 cwt 1711-3330 lbs = $6 cwt 3331 and greater = $5 cwt Example: 1500 lbs would be 1500 / 100 * $7 = $105.

You could also use an IFS: =ifs(A1<1711, A1*7,A1<3331,A1*6,A1>3330,A1*5) (Ifs is a special form of if designed for several if statements to slightly reduce the amount of nesting, if will check each if in turn and return that result if true, otherwise it will go to the next if).", "Thank you for your response I think where I am getting tripped up is the second condition is a \"between\" so that if the pounds are between 1711 and 3330 then the amount charged per cwt is $6.

But if statements are not designed to worry about \"between,\" you use two ifs for that. The trick is to remember that excel follows each \"if\" rule in order, so once it has done the first task, any number affected by that if statement is not available to the later if statements.

For me, there are two issues: 1) Privacy of course. 2) I'm on a metered network - phone company 4G. I'm already paying a ton of money per month and sometimes exceed my my limit costing me even more. I'm actually paranoid about the OS and other programs sending data from my computer to places unknown and concerned about how much these transfers are costing me. I have turned off automatic sample submission for now but I have this constant warning that my device may be vulnerable. How is this? Is this just a lousy way of MS getting me to submit my files to them (at my cost) or am I truly at some additional level of risk? If I turn on automatic submission I assume files of various content and size will be shipped off to Microsoft. Correct? To address my paranoia, I wonder if there is any tool that summarizes outbound data transfers and the information being sent. I'm really starting to think I'm wrong by trusting MS firewall and AV tools. I understand nothing is free but I paid for this OS and I pay for my metered network connection and I'd like some control or at least visibility.", "Or Would you prefer to install a third party antivirus program since doing so should disable WD?

I also want to understand why I have everything about Windows Defender turned on except automatic sample submission and I'm told my device may be vulnerable. As for taking measures to replace Defender I don't think I'm there yet. Defender has served me well for years. I'm just trying to control what is sent from my computer without my knowledge both from a privacy and money point of view. If I download a new program - something just recently released and the size is 1 GB does that mean MS might choose to sample that file and now it costs me 2 GB of my data? If I have a file on my computer that is a scan of my paycheck or W2, will this be sent to Microsoft? This is the type of thing I'm trying to get some visibility into. Kev", "If you'll be patient hopefully someone else will respond to you. I've used MSE since 2010 on XP, Vista and Win 7 and am using Windows Defender on my Win 10 and I've never had a reason to address in detail the concerns that you have raised. The sample files as I understand it are just analyzed to see if they're possibly malicious but I've no idea how much data usage is potentially involved. If you do not receive a satisfactory response from a different poster in this thread you might try researching Technet or perhaps posting your question in the Technet forum. Regards.... It's not likely that your PC will need to submit entire files to Microsoft's servers very often, since in most cases the executable files that Defender would be concerned with would be digitally signed and so later copies could be verified via the file's signature data alone. This means that only the first PC to download such a file would need to actually upload and even then only if something about it seemed suspicious to the Defender monitoring components. For less well known executable files from marginal software developers (think less popular games or similar programs) the potential need for upload goes up, but even then if the file's size, checksum and other data matched earlier samples from others, it still shouldn't be necessary. And remember, there still must be something questionable that Defender sensed about the file to make it of interest. If you read the short paragraph for the Automatic sample submission setting, you'll note that it mentions you will be prompted if the file they need is likely to contain personal information. What this means is that Defender will prompt you with the file name, path and ask for your permission before sending any files such as documents or spreadsheets for example, while executables will typically be sent silently. So overall, your risk to privacy is very low, though Microsoft's own Privacy Statement regarding Microsoft Security Essentials doesn't describe this in a comforting manner as you'll see in the excerpt I've copied further below. I assume there's an equivalent section to this for Defender embedded within the Windows 10 Privacy Statement as well, but I found this document more easily. Unless you commonly download huge installer or other files that aren't signed and may contain questionable executable files which might peak Defender's interest, I typically wouldn't expect to see much if anything uploaded from most machines. Also note that Microsoft has paid more attention to metered Internet connections with Windows 10, though I don't know whether they've specifically tuned Defender to pay attention to this or not. Grant Automatic sample submission What this feature does: The product contains functionality that may identify certain files as potentially unwanted and may request further information to make an assessment.

I'm very stingy with my data consumption, something I wish was not necessary these days. But I have no access to any non-metered network at my location other than 128 Kbps DSL. I will enable the feature in Defender and try to keep an eye on its use. I wonder if usage details in network settings will track Defender's file transfer size.

{"conversations": ["changed my Hotmail password, now I can't log into admin account on my desktop computer. [SEP] I changed my Hotmail email password. I know my new password is right, because it lets me sign into my email. I restarted my computer the next day, and now I cannot log in to my admin account on my desktop. 4 days ago I contacted Microsoft support. Today they ended up closing my support ticket, and told me to come here, since this was a Win8.1 problem. So it has been a few days now, and I am very distraught over it. I do not have other devices. I only have this computer. I do not have a cell phone connected to the internet. I didn't forget my password, it just isn't working, to sign in to my admin account. Luckily I made a guest account, or I would not be on the internet period now. I have a Win 8 computer, that has been upgraded to Win8.1 Why they think it was a good idea to connect your password to a Microsoft account is beyond me. Now I am in one heck of a bind.", "Hi Joan, Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities. Sorry to know that you are experiencing issues logging into the Windows 8.1 account. This issue could occur due to in-correct syncing of the Microsoft account. Let's try to narrow down to see what is causing this issue and try to fix it. What is the exact/complete error message displayed when you try to enter the password? Note: Passwords are case-sensitive. Make sure you don't have Caps Lock turned on. Disconnect the internet connection and then try to enter the old password to login to your account. If issue persist even after the entering the old password, try to login using the new password. There could be issues with sync. Also, check the Keyboard Language Layout PCs configured to support more than one language will display the current keyboard language layout in the lower-right portion of the sign-in screen, directly to the left of the power icon. For example, EN is displayed for English. If you see a language option, make sure you’re entering your password with the correct language characters. (Note: If you are successful in resetting your password, make sure your laptop is connected to the internet using an Ethernet cable.) Let us know if it helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.", "The exact thing it says when I try to log in is The Username or Password Is Incorrect. That is all it says. Then it has an okay button. I know that I am typing in the right password. As I said, I use it to sign into my Hotmail, and it works. I do not have a lap top. I have a desk top only. After I changed my password, and saw that it worked, I destroyed the old password. You have to make them so difficult because of hackers, that you cannot remember them. As far as KEYBOARD LANGUAGE Layout, I do not see anything like that on the sign in screen. On the right it allows you to shutdown. (this is bottom right) The bottom left has ease of access, and connect to internet. I am still not able to sign in to my main account, which is the admin account, on my desktop. I do not have any other way to get online, just this computer only. I would have replied sooner, but I never got notification that I had a reply. Oh, and after I could not get into my account the first time, I had to jump through hoops to get my password reset on Microsoft/Hotmail. I got another password. I can sign into Hotmail with it. Neither password will allow me to log into my admin account, on my desktop. So resetting the password did not work, but I did rule that out. I cannot get into my admin account on the computer, and this is very bad. I am stuck with a guest account only.. Will a System Restore work to get rid of that password, or do I need to completely start from scratch?. So Microsoft forced me to come here for help. They closed my ticket, and pushed me here for help. I questioned this from my support ticket. They are sending me to a community forum for goodness sakes, when I had the real Microsoft support going on, with a ticket. This has not gotten the problem fixed. I will have to start from scratch. I will most likely get LINUX for my next computer. In fact I already ordered a Linux dvd. I will be trying to decide if I can change over to Linux entirely. Microsoft you blew it this time.

With the exclusion set, try right clicking on the folder in Windows Explorer and selecting Scan with MSE to see if it will scan while that folder is actually excluded.

{"conversations": ["What is the proper way to link tables to share fields?. [SEP] I have been learning how to create a relational database in Access. I have been watching a tutorial that says that you can use the lookup wizard to create a relationship from one table to another. I have a database that has roughy 4 to 5 tables. One table has fields that will be common to two customers tables. I was trying to link them up so i could enter the info in the shared table & display the same selections in a field in the customer table. This would be things such as the state that the project is in, etc. I was under the impression that the proper way to do this was to have the selections in one table & then create a relationship so that you are only storing the info once. The tutorial said to use the lookup wizard but when i tried this i got an error saying \"You can't modify the structure of table'tblTableName', because it is already in use by another person or process.\" This is a brand new table so i am not sure how something is linked to it. I have since done a google search & found some similar situations such as mine & it seems as though people are saying that you shouldn't link tables this way. What is the proper way to do this? Also is it possible to link a field that has a yes/no data type into another table?", "If the tutorial is recommending the use of the lookup field wizard, then I should stop using that tutorial. Most experienced Access developers would strongly recommend against the use of this feature. For reasons why see: What do you mean by 'One table has fields that will be common to two customers tables'? Does this imply that you have two sub-types of type customer? If so the two tables modelling the sub-types should each reference the table modelling the (super) type in a one-to-one relationship type. This is achieved by the primary key of each table modelling a sub-type also being a foreign key referencing the primary key of the table modelling the (super) type. It would be helpful if you could provide details of all your tables. The easiest way to do so would be to post an image of the database's relationships window, set out clearly so that all columns (fields) of each table are visible, and whatever relationships you have established between them are clearly shown. The image below is an example, in this case from my DatabaseBasics demo: You might like to take a look at this file, which you'll find as DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at: Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar. This little demo file, as its name suggests, is a simple introduction to some of the basic principles and methodologies of designing a relational database. Amongst other things, it explains the different relationship types, including the one-to-one relationship type, with a simple example of a type/sub-type model in which such a relationship type is used. Another file in the same OneDrive folder which you might find useful is Normalization.zip. This is a brief introduction to the important topic of normalization, which is at the heart of good relational database design.", "I work for an architecture firm. We have two main customers that we do the majority of our work for. One is McDonalds & one is Wendy's restaurants. My tables consist of building properties that might be included in various projects such as building construction type, etc. McDonald's has a couple of different project types so i have a McDonalds shared table called \"tblMcDonaldsBldgProperties\" that has properties that could be in several McDonalds tables. The table called \"tblMcDonaldasArcade\" would link up to the shared McDonalds table in order to select from a field that is in \"tblMcDonaldsBldgProperties\". Also McDonalds & Wendys could have common fields such as the type of exterior wall configurations. I have created a table called \"tblSharedBldgProperties\" that would contain fields such as ProjectYear, ExstMainBldgWalls, etc. that i would connect to from either \"tblMcDonaldasArcade\" or \"Wendys\" & be able to display those fields selections from the shared properties tables into the customer project table. My goal was to create the fields once in a shared table & be able to use those selections in each one of my customer tables. I have not created any relationships as of yet. That is what i am trying to create now.", "I'm sorry to say that your table designs are way off target. What you have done, by having a multiplicity of columns, is what is known as 'encoding data as column headings'. A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1). This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other way. In essence you are using tables as you would use worksheets in an Excel workbook. You are not alone in this; it is a common error amongst inexperienced database developers. Don't be misled by the superficial similarity between a table's datasheet and an Excel worksheet. Databases and spreadsheets are very different in both concept and structure. Correcting your design would not be a matter of minor adjustments. For it to operate as a relational database you would really have to go back to square one and rebuild the model on the basis of the established principles of the database relational model. This would require a complete reanalysis of the real world situation with which the database is concerned, in terms of its entity types, their attributes and the relationship types between the entity types. I realise this is not the advice you would like to have received, and I take no pleasure in giving it. I would be doing you no favours, however, to pretend that there is an easier solution.. To add to what Judy said, relational database tables should be tall and thin, not wide. I would suggest something like this might work for you. tblCustomer CustomerID (Primary Key Autonumber) CustomerName CustomerAddress etc. tblProject ProjectID (PK Autonumber) ProjectTitle ProjectAddress CustomerID (Foreign Key) etc. tblProjectProperties ProjectPropertyID (PK AutoNumber) ProjectID (FK) PropertyID (FK) PropertyValue tluProperty PropertyID (PK Autonumber) Property So each property of the project represents a record in a table, not a field. And I would also agree with KenJudy to stop using those tutorials. Anyone who would recommend using lookup fields on the table level is not an experienced developer.", "That's interesting. I did not think about it in that way. So it looks like i am going to need a few more tables than what i had thought. You are saying i would have one table that has the customers names, customer address, etc. In my case that would be McDonald's & Wendy's. Our McDonald's projects have what i guess you would call a sub section which would be the project type. For instance the projects that are in New York City which are called \"Manhattan projects\" (i know, i laughed at this one too when i first heard it) & they are different than the McDonald's projects that are in other states. The New York City projects are street stores where as some other McDonald's projects that we do are freestanding buildings. Wendy's projects are all under the Wendy's table umbrella. The McDonald's project types are as follows: Arcade Manhattan Project MRP Manhattan Project MFRESH RA Our network file system is broken down into these groups. In other words a 2015 project number may be 15Arcade04, 05. etc. So maybe i need a project type table that the customer table would have a relationship with? I would have another table that would have project number, project addresses, city state, etc. I would then have a building properties table that would have the various elements that a project might have? I would create a relationship between the project type table & the building properties table?", "I'll agree with the others, it may be time to try a different tutorial. The terminology you are using \"a table that has fields common to 2 customer tables\" and \"I as trying to link them so I could enter the into into the shared table\" A table is a collection of fields on a specific subject, ie a customer, an order A table will have a key to uniquely identify each row. A table may contain foreign keys from another table to speed up access to that other table. Ideally you access data in a table using the key. You can \"join\" 2 or more tables to display the data all at once in a form. Eventually you are going to have to learn about \"normalization\" To start with just worry about the first \"3 rules\". With more experience you can work on the higher level rules. It's tough to summarize a couple of semesters of database design class into a short reply.. Makes the quote from Richard Feynman below my signature even more apposite! Your Customers table would have one row per customer, one for McDonald's, one for Wendy's and so on for your other customers. As each customer can relate to many projects there is a one-to-many relationship type between customers and Projects, so the Projects table would have a foreign key column CustomerID referencing the primary key of Customers. If each project can encompass more than one building, but a building can relate to only one project, then the Buildings table would have a ProjectID foreign key column. If, on the other hand a building can relate to more than one project the relationship type is many-to-many. A many-to-many relationship type is modelled by a separate table which resolves it in two or more one-to-many relationship type's, so in this case a ProjectBuildings table would have two foreign keys, ProjectID and BuildingID, referencing the primary keys of the Projects and Buildings tables. When it comes to addresses, you should not have both city and state columns in the referencing table, only a CityID foreign key referencing the primary key of a Cities table, which in turn would have a StateID foreign key column referencing the primary key of a States table. You can see this in the image I posted earlier where the Contacts table has a CityID column referencing a Cities table and via that, Regions (generically equivalent to States) and Countries table. The contacts form in my demo illustrates how the address data can be entered top-down by means of correlated combo boxes, which cater for the fact that two cities of the same name can be in different regions. My demo uses Paris, Texas and Paris, France as examples. Bear in mind that in the USA there are instances of two cities with the same name in the same state, however, Springfield being an example."], "final_answer": "I'll agree with the others, it may be time to try a different tutorial.

Almost as soon as I bought my new SurfacePro3 and Card 4 weeks ago. 2. Yes all the updates for my Surface have been installed -- even the optional ones. 3. Yes, I have a 64GB that I removed from my old Android Note10.1 reformatted to fit this application and it still unmounts when in sleep mode or if I'm working on my tablet. As for the USB flashes, I have not experienced random unmounting as much as I am with the SDcard. 4. If the card is left in the tablet and I do a cold boot it will see the card. It's only unmounting with sleep and during extended \"up time\" (when I'm using the table - like now). 5. Yes, restarting does help, but unlike my old Galaxy I should not have to restart or reboot just to get my sdcard to mount and stay mounted! 6. Yes, the card was reformatted 3 times and checked for errors each time. Now, it is just in the table and when it unmounts (like it just did as I was answering your above questions) I just simply pull the card out and reinsert! Ugh a pain.

Also another thought on the microSD card slot on the Pro 3. I also have the Surface RT and the microSD slot on the RT has a spring, I have to push the card for it to be ejected out of the slot. The Pro 3 doesn't have that, it's a simple push/pull.

There seems to be no way to do this, and it's a serious drawback to the use of Edge. It was easy to do on IE; surely something this simple wasn't omitted in designing Edge.", "Hi, Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. I understand your inconvenience. We will assist you with it. I would like to inform you that, this option is still not available in Microsoft Edge. I suggest you to send a feedback to Microsoft regarding this feature. Hope this information helps. If you have any queries, let us know. Will be happy to assist you. Thank you.. Why even after setting up a custom website, with Edge that it opens every time to MSN? So MSN is in your face and I then have to click on my chosen page for it to open rather than with ie10 my home page would open automatically. And when will Edge have the internet option to automatically clear history upon exiting?. Definitely need to fix deleting history on exit. It is a pain the way it is at the moment have to manually do it & may forget which is not good when other people may be using your computer. For your customers security you should fix this in edge. Can't believe you guys left this out or was it on purpose?. I also find it an annoyance that it is not automatic. although I can understand the logic I do not like that I DO NOT have the option. I think is very important for the security of my information, to automatically delete History each time I exit the browser. There is many thinks I dont like of Edge, I think Explorer was better.. Answer is go into internet options - select advanced - then tick clear temporary internet files on exit that should solve your problem. Ticking clear temporary files does not work with edge. I have tried doing that but it no longer works it has been blocked, clear your history using anti virus or edge there is no auto setting.. It is a pain that Edge does not have a setting to allow you to auto delete history.... if this concerns you just open the \"more actions\" tab, top right corner and select a new private window. By doing this , when you close the window , history will not be saved. Hope this helps.. . This is ridiculous, you are the largest software company in the universe and you still can't make it simple for people to do the most simple tasks. I tried to send feedback and my computer wants me to assign it a password and use a Microsoft account. I have a Microsoft account, don't want a password on my computer. I also do not want the browser history to go un deleted because you failed to add one of the most basic functions. I will not use edge as my primary browser until this is fixed. Getting this information to your company is also a joke. There is no direct way to send this to the development team to let them know they skipped one of the most important features in any browser.. Hi, We apologize for the inconvenience. Since Microsoft Edge is a new", "\"It is very possible to delete your browsing history in Microsoft edge, Just take your time and read and click every link, it is there.\" Of course it's possible to delete browsing history in Edge; looks like everyone who has posted here already knows that. The comments are about automatically delete browsing history when Edge is closed without having to delete it manually each time you use Edge. This was easily done with IE. Not so with Edge. What we're hoping, of course, is that Microsoft will realize the omission of this rather simple and very useful tool -- and correct that omission.", "Hi Bob, Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. Please post a feedback on the enhancements to be made using Feedback App in Windows 10. We will make sure that, the feedback given by you will be considered and worked on. Write to us for assistance regarding any Windows related issue, we will be happy to assist. Thank you.. Not being able to have history cleared upon exiting the browser is not acceptable. It will be the reason that I stop using edge.. While Edge offers the option to clear the browser history automatically on exit, it doesn't actually work at all. The history remains. So your followed links keep their followed-link color, and your browser remains logged on to certain websites if you didn't actually log out of them. (Imagine the potential implications of that after using a shared, accessible or vulnerable computer somewhere -- like an Internet café or large workplace!) Nor can you manually execute a successful deletion of the browser history by using the Disk Cleanup tool. That tool only pretends to delete the history. It doesn't actually work: the history remains. You will think you've deleted it, but if you run the tool again immediately afterward, it shows the same amount of browser history files still sitting there. (It does seem to successfully delete the other things you select for deletion, though.) So, is there a secret cache of browser history lying around that's leftover from your old version of IE that Edge hasn't been programmed to delete (even though it knows how to count it)? Is Edge only deleting the browser history of the first tab it opens, but not the history of additional tabs? Is the delete function not properly pointed at the data that needs to be deleted? (Inquiring minds, etc.). The only way at moment is to delete in Edge, and then your IE followed by a disk clean up if not some of your history remains. 1. MS needs to integrate edge that your history can be deleted like latest IE browser like on MSN web page simple easy At present is edge based like a short cut app for internet so there is need that when press delete history that internet then appear with delete history Edge and IE or the NSN page appears and you click delete history new window appears with two tick boxes one for Edge and for IE your tick both and they stay ticked clearing both. 2. Second option that your clean disk appears and under clear temporary internet files with it ticked add Edge internet temporary internet history with tick with it box ticked and these defaults in windows 10 3. At present the this leaves a safety issue for viruses, malware, and wanted adware at is not picked up windows defender with windows 10 so my advice is download IOBIT Anti malware version 4 beta 1.00 designed for windows 10 and do a full complete scan and you see what missed. 4. REMEMBER to make full backup of all files and programmes before upgrading", "Amanda: What you describe in your first paragraph is the *manual* deletion of History; it must be done *each time* you exit the browser. Internet Explorer had another feature, which is missing on Edge; you could click for *automatic* deletion of History, and each time you exit the browser your history is deleted -- with no more required on your part than the initial choice. This is done only once, and the action (deletion of History) is taken automatically every time you exit IE. This is the action people miss in Edge and are asking for in this thread. It is surprising that something so simple in IE is completely missing in Edge. Perhaps at some point Microsoft will correct this omission in an update, but as far as I know they have not done that yet.", "I appreciate your taking the time to respond, but the question is, how do we make edge automatically delete browsing history upon exiting the edge app?

Probably bill gates collaborating with the government. Microsoft's days are numbered if the refuse to protect our privacy like apple did.. Just an update...

{"conversations": ["Why are the date and date format changing in the footer when I convert a Word docx to PDF?. [SEP] I created a custom document property, VersionDate, as a date field in a Release Notes document template, so I could show the release date in the footer. Since the release notes are issued in multiple countries, I used a date format that clearly shows what the month and day are-- \\@ \"MMMM d, yyyy\" (e.g., August 29, 2017). The field always displays properly in Word, but when I use the Acrobat plugin to save the document in PDF format, the date is converted to the U.S. format, \\@ \"MM/dd/yyyy\" and set back by one day (e.g., August 29 to August 28). This happens only if the date field is placed in the header or footer. The same field placed in the body of the text displays the correct date and format after conversion. This bug is particularly annoying since most of our customers are in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, which don't use this U.S. date format. (I'm in Australia, and there's nothing in my system settings that explains why a U.S. format would be used. In fact, the entry field for the custom document property asks for and stores the date in the dd/mm/yyyy format.) Does anyone know why this is happening and what can be done to fix it? I reported the problem to Adobe, but they say it is a Microsoft problem. Gabrielle", "Do you mean that you created the custom field with the format MMMM, d yyyy ? Create the custom field with your local short date format. It is a date field so will adopt the local date format wherever the document is opened. You can display the field in the document using the date formatting switch { DOCPROPERTY VersionDate \\@ \"MMMM dd, yyyy\" }. Hi Gabrielle_VIXVerity, From your description, I know that the issue only happens in the header and the footer with the date using the format like September 11, 2017. Please confirm and provide the following? 1. How do you create the custom document? Could you list the detailed steps? 2. Confirm whether the issue happens in a specific file. 3. Upload a full screenshot showing the version information of Word 2016 for Mac you are using. Generally, if you set the current date for the document templates, you can insert the date with the date format like September 11, 2017 via the steps in the article and then covert the documents to PDF to see the result. Thanks, Matthew. What happens if instead of using the Add-In, you use File > SaveAs and select pdf as the file type. If it works with that and not with the Add-In, I would hazard a guess that the problem lies with the Add-In. I can't replicate your problem, but I am using an older version of Acrobat.. I see this problem on Mac Word 2016 (I am using Word version 15.38, Slow Insider build) with Acrobat Pro DC However, as far as I can tell, there are really three options when you convert to PDF when you have the Adobe plugin installed. If you have a subscription to the Adobe cloud converter, you can use that. I do not have one, so cannot test what happens in that case. Otherwise, although Adobe's online documentation suggests that Word then uses Adobe's \"local\" converter, in fact the plugin just seems to take you to the standard Mac Word 2016 Save As PDF dialog box. In that, there are two options, the one that uses Microsoft's Online service, and the \"Best for Printing\" one that uses the local converter (which is either Microsoft's or APple's, not Adobe's. If I use the local converter, the date is formatted correctly according to the date format you inserted. If I use Microsoft's online converter, the date appears as you say (i.e. it is in US format and one day out). In addition, what goes wrong appears to depend on the format you chose for the custom document property itself (in the File->Properties->Custom dialog box). If you choose Date, the day is 1 out. If you choose Text, it depends on how you actually enter the data in the properties dialog. If I use \"YYYY-MM-DD\" there is no problem. If, however, I use DD/MM/YYYY, I actually see a date in US format but with the *Year* reduced by one. If you are using Microsoft's online converter then I can see why Adobe might be confident that it is", "You can't create a custom document property with a particular format, if you use the File > Properties > Custom Properties form. You just specify the type -- in this case Date -- and the dialog lets you enter the date in the system default format -- in our case d/m/yyyy. That's what I did. When I inserted the field into the footer, I specified the format switch you indicated: { DOCPROPERTY VersionDate \\@ \"MMMM dd, yyyy\" }. As I said, the field looked fine in Word. It was only when I converted the document to PDF, using the Acrobat plugin, that the format in the footer changed to the mm/dd/yyyy format, and the date itself converted to a day earlier. The actual date field value remained the same in the original Word file, (e.g., 29/8/2917) but the PDF showed \"08/28/2017\" in the footer. Even more puzzling was that when I copied the same field, from the footer into the body of the text, the PDF plugin converted the date properly. I tried doing this in different documents, to make sure the document itself wasn't corrupted, but the result was the same: If I put the date field in a header or footer, the date and format were changed in the PDF file.. Thanks for your extensive testing. We do have a subscription to the Adobe Cloud service as well as Acrobat Pro DC, and I tried converting the document using all three products (the third being the Acrobat Plug-in in Word). When I tried converting the document on the Cloud or Pro DC, the date was formatted correctly, but it was still wrong -- one day earlier -- whenever I placed the field in a header or footer. As you say, in the Plug-in (File > Save As PDF) this happens using the \"best for electronic distribution\" option. When I tried the \"best for print\" option or File > Print as PDF (which uses Adobe Acrobat Distiller), the date rendered correctly. (But since this option also strips out all hyperlinks, it's not solution for us.) That's why I thought it was an Adobe issue, but when I reported the problem to Adobe, the support person pointed out that if you look at the footer in Print > Preview, the date is wrong, and that happens before the file goes to Distiller, so it had to be a Microsoft issue. I couldn't replicate the Print > Preview problem on my system (Word for Mac Version 15.33 on macOS Sierra 10.12.6), but if the support person had that issue with Print Preview showing the wrong date on her system, it was a compelling argument for the problem occurring before Acrobat does anything with it. Gabrielle. Hi Matthew, Yes, the issue happens only in the header and footer. I haven't tested all the date formats, but the plugin always uses the \\@ \"d/M/yyyy\" format irrespective of the format switch I've entered in the field. These are the formats I've tested: \\@ \"MMMM d, yyyy\" and \\@ \"dd-MMM-yyyy\". 1. If you mean, how did I", "I revisited the problem following your comments.

{"conversations": ["can I add an image while speaking. [SEP] I would like an image to a video recording I have made but still hear the audio of my voice. Is this possible, if so how?", "It's possible, but rather complicated. The first thing you need to do is add the picture. Next add the video as the *audio*. To do this, go to the Home tab and click the down arrow next to Record narration. In the drop-down, pick Add sound... The default file type is Audio and Music, so in the drop-down, change that to Videos. Finally pick your video with you speaking. You may need to extend the duration of the photo or trim the audio down to just the portion you want.", "My intent is the add more than one image. Since you suggest \"add the image first\" how to I select the spot where the image should be? If I add the image first won't it appear right at the beginning of the video? Also, I wish to add several images. Can I do that and how?", "If you don't need any of the original video, just your voice, then the method above works. You can then put whatever visual elements you want on the video track. You could have other videos, multiple photos, etc. In essence, your video of you speaking just acts like the music or sound track to your movie. If you need to both have the original video and then pictures at certain spots, that's even harder to do. Basically you have to add your video to the storyboard first. Then set it so its volume is zero (mute). Then add a copy of just the audio portion as explained above. Now you have the video and the audio being treated as separate entities. At that point you could trim out any portion of video and replace it with an equal portion of another video or a photo. For example, you could split out 7 seconds of video, delete that portion and replace it with a 7 second photo. The hardest part is keeping the two tracks in sync. Now that they are separate you have to be responsible for every edit you make so that the audio still matches your speaking when you return to the original video. This would be a lot easier in a program where you can have multiple video tracks (not Movie Maker). In such a program, you would just put the photos or alternate video on a separate track above the original track. The photo would show and then when it was done, you'd see the original video and still hear its synched audio. In other words, yes you can do this in Movie Maker if you jump through lots of hoops, but if you plan to do this on a regular basis, you should look for video editing software that has multiple video tracks. Despite years of requests for more tracks Microsoft has never allowed for more than 1 video track.

Based on my research it appears that the following event VBA code is very outdated: Private Sub Form_Load() If Me.OpenArgs = \"GotoNew\" And Not IsNull(Me![SubjectMatterID]) Then DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70 End If End Sub I've found the following which does not make sense for acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70: 0 Undo 1 Cut 2 Copy 3 Paste 6 Delete 8 Select record 9 Select all records I want to open the form: SubjectMattersTypes\" in datasheet view instead of form view. I'm seeing macros are being created in my database instead of VBA when I use one of the wizards. Are macros replacing VBA event procedures? Thanks for the help, Robert", "You can open a form in Datasheet mode like this: DoCmd.OpenForm \"SubjectMattersTypes\", acFormDS For more on the OpenForm command:", "Cynthia, thanks for the help. It did not work. Let me add that my Switchboard is from a very old version of Access. For any form the Switchboard manager allows 2 options: (1) Open Form in Add Mode or (2) Open Form in Edit Mode. I did a variations of the language: DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70 without just the numbers 3 and 0 but the comas remained. I did so many variations that I cannot remember which one gave me the same error, but opened the form in datasheet view after I closed the VBA event procedure. I got the following error: Argument not optional (Error 449). I looked it up and found the following: The number and types of arguments must match those expected. This error has the following causes and solutions: Robert", "The line: DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70 moves the record pointer to an empty new record in the form when the form's recordset is loaded. It is still supported in Access 2016, but is outmoded code. Now the same thing would probably be done like this: DoCmd.GoToRecord acForm, Me.Name, acNewRec However, in neither case does it have anything to do with opening a form in datasheet view. If you want a form to open in datasheet view every time then simply change the form's DefaultView property accordingly in design view and save the form. If you want a form to open in a specific view in different contexts then do so, not in the form's Load event procedure, but in the code in the calling procedure which opens the form, by setting the View argument of the OpenForm method to the appropriate constant, which for a datasheet is acFormDS, as Cynthia has pointed out.", "Lori thanks for the help. Then the Switchboard's command: \"Open Form in Edit Mode\" and/or the automatically generated by the Switchboard Manager Onload event procedure appear to be over riding the form's DefaultView property that has been set to Datasheet view for years. When I go to the Navigation pane and open the form \"Subject Matter Types\" it opens in datasheet view. Since the Switchboard Manager created the OnLoad event procedure I assumed, it appears incorrectly, that it controls the statement: DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70. Even from my Fortran days I can interpret the DoCmd and DoMenuItem. However, the remaining parts of this statement I did not understand. That's when I found out the statement has outdated code from the 1990s. Thus my question. I'm trying to get the Switchboard button when I click it for the Switchboard item \"Grievance Subject Matter Types\" for the Switchboard command \"Open Form in Edit Mode\" for the Switchboard form \"Subject Matter Types\" to open in that form's DefaultView's setting of Datasheet. Below is the latest iteration that I've tried and the Switchboard form item \"Subject Matter Types\" and the form still opens in acFormBar mode: Private Sub Form_Load() If Me.OpenArgs = \"GotoNew\" And Not IsNull(Me![SubjectMatterID]) Then DoCmd.OpenQuery \"GrievSubjectMattersQry\" 'DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70 'DoCmd.OpenForm \"SubjectMattersTypes\", acFormDS End If End Sub Last thing, I'm the president of a local union that represents about 2,200 bargaining unit employees for the Postal Service in the US. That's my full-time job. I did not get home from work until 2:00 am this morning. I do this for my local because I enjoy doing it. More than likely because of my programming days in the late 1960s. And, because we can't afford to pay someone thousand of dollars to hopefully do it right. Robert", "If you simply want to open the form and show all rows as a datasheet, you don't need any code at all in the form's Load event procedure, so you can delete the procedure completely. The code to open the form will be somewhere in the switchboard form's module. It's many years since I've had any contact with a switchboard form, and then only rarely, as I will normally design a database's opening menu form from scratch, using conventional command button's with code in the Click event procedure of each. Switchboard forms work rather differently, however, and get a lot of their stuff from a Switchboard Items table if I remember rightly. Exactly where in the switchboard form's module the code to open the SubjectMattersTypes form will be I can't say for certain. The switchboard manager is no longer part of Access by default (it now relies more on navigation forms for this sort of functionality) so I can't create a switchboard form and examine its module myself.

To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things: 1. Is the issue only related to one specific ppt file or all files? Do you store them in cloud storage or local drive? 2. When do you encounter this issue, after some Office or Mac OS updates? 3. Is this ppt created on your Mac or other devices? You can try changing several pictures in this problematic presentation. Save the change. And then open the presentation next day, check if these pictures will change back to the error message. Best regards, TimMichael. Hi April WB, Are there any updates? You may share with us some updates when you have time. Regards, TimMichael. Unfortunately, once you've seen this error message, it means that Powerpoint has corrupted the file. There's no (currently known) way to retrieve the lost pictures, other than reverting to a previously saved version of the file, if you have one. If you decide to reconstruct the file in PPT 2016, there are a few steps you can take to avoid or possibly eliminate the possibility of this happening again: First: Make sure your copy of PPT has all available updates. Next: When working on the file, ALWAYS open from/save to a copy of the file on your local hard drive. Never open from/save to files on removable storage (thumb drives, etc). Copy the file from removable storage to your hard drive, open it from there, save it, then move it back to removable storage if need be. On the hard drive, don't store the file in a location that's automatically backed up/synched. Or temporarily turn off the auto backup/synching while you're working on the file. Regularly save the file to a new name to give yourself a trail of saved files in good condition to go back to in case the one you're working on gets whacked: Myfile-001 Myfile-002 and so on", "Michael, SteveSandra, Thank you for taking the time to answer my question. Luckily, I still had the file that was created on the fail-proof standalone version of 2008 PowerPoint for MAC otherwise I would have had to recreate the entire file.

I imagine, the same rules apply. I hope there is a fix for this soon. Thank you again for your suggestions and response. I appreciate it. Wynne. Michael, Here are some answers: 1. Is the issue only related to one specific ppt file or all files? Do you store them in cloud storage or local drive? I just started using PP 2016 for MAC, and have only created two files; one was an earlier saved version of the same PP file (just in case). Both files became corrupted. They are stored locally, on my internal hard drive, not on a peripheral drive or on off-site server. 2. When do you encounter this issue, after some Office or Mac OS updates? No MAC OS updates occurred and I'm pretty sure PP was not updated. I was just working on the files. I have a 500GB internal drive, which is down to 45GB, and I thought maybe that affected it. There were a number of other applications open.3. Is this ppt created on your Mac or other devices? The PPT was created only on the MAC. I was going to convert it to Keynote so I could play it on my iPad. It might just be better to use PP in its native setting (on a PC).

{"conversations": ["Inking pdf files in OneNote is not consistent across different devices. [SEP] When I insert a pdf directly into a onenote page and then use the drawing features to mark it up and take notes on my asus tablet, everything seems to work fine. However, when I open these annotated files in onenote on my PC, the inking and pdf do not line up at all. It seems that the sizing and placement of the inking remains consistent while the background pdf has a different default location, size and aspect ratio(?). Is there a direct fix for this extremely annoying problem, or at least a clever workaround?", "Hi Mattorourke17, To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following information: 1.Regarding \"when I open these annotated files in onenote on my PC, the inking and pdf do not line up at all.\" \"the background pdf has a different default location, size and aspect ratio(?). \" Please provide related screenshots to describe it. (both on tablet and PC) 2.For inserting a PDF file into a OneNote page, please provide your detailed steps. 3.Please also provide the detailed version number of OneNote both in tablet and PC. 4.Does it happens to a specific OneNote page or all pages? Regards, Jason. Hi Mattorourke17, Are you still experiencing the issue? Let us know if you need further assistance. Regards, Jason", "Hi Jason, Sorry for the slow response. In regards to your 4 points in your first response, I will try to reply sequentially. 1) this is the OneNote page as viewed (and annotated) correctly on my Asus tablet running Android: And then this is the exact same OneNote page when I open it in OneNote Online on my laptop (running linux): 2) Since directly inserting a pdf into a OneNote page is not an available feature on OneNote for Adroid, my process for inserting a pdf file into a OneNote page is as follows: -Open Onedrive Online on my laptop and open a notebook in OneNote Online -under the \"insert\" tab, choose \"file printout\" and select the desired pdf to insert into the page -Open Onedrive for android on my asus tablet and select the notebook and page with the newly uploaded/inserted pdf -mark up the page using OneNote's inking options 3) OneNote on android tablet is version 16.0.8366.1765, OneNote on pc is OneNote Online with build ID 16.0.8521.1900 4) This appears to happen to all OneNote pages to which I upload a pdf on OneNote online, successfully ink it on Android tablet, and then re-open on OneNote online to find the inking very askew. I understand that since the window sizes are different the default size/aspect ratio of the inserted pdf will be different on the two separate devices/operating systems. However, it seems to me that even if the ratios and sizes are different, the inking/text boxes should simply stretch out and deform a bit to match how the same file is displayed across different systems. Either that or there should be a way to ensure that the inserted pdf files maintain the same size and ratio relative to the inking regardless of what device the OneNote page is opened on. Thank you very much for your attentive help TinaJason! If there are any more details that you need from me, please don't hesitate to ask! I hope this problem is simply do to user error and there is a feature already built in that avoids this type of problem! -Matt", "No, your problem is just another example of a missing cross platform quality management on the side of Microsoft.

Erica", "If you can print a test page from the printer, at least the printer's hardware seems to be functioning. When you mentioned that you can't print a test page from within \"Device Manager\" do you really mean from the \"Devices and Printers\" window? That is, the usual method for printing test pages is to right-click on a printer's icon in \"Devices and Printers,\" select \"Printer properties\" and use the \"Print test page\" button from the \"General\" tab of the \"Printer properties\" dialog. The HP LaserJet Pro p1102 is one of HP's lower-cost \"host-based printers.\" This means that the computer itself is used to perform all of the print processing. I'm not very familiar with this type of printer, but I'll try to help you out. Open Devices and Printers If you go to Control Panel > Programs and Features (click Start, type Programs and Features in the Search box, and press Enter), what HP software is listed there? Although you didn't specifically say so, it sounds as if you have at least one other printer installed on this computer. Is that an HP printer also? Microsoft used to have an automated \"Fixit\" routine that solved a great many printer problems. The article describing the Fixit is still online at Like much of Windows 7 support, however, Microsoft \"retired\" this Fixit, as you will see if you click the buttons on that page. Fortunately, the \"guts\" of that routine were saved by the Microsoft Print Team and are still available, although things are not quite as automated as they once were. The Fixit has two modes, Light and Full. Although I suspect that the Light mode will not fix your problem, it won't adversely affect your system and you may want to try it while I'm waiting for your response to the above questions. The Full mode may well solve your problem although it's primarily intended for the more usual printer-based printing problems. I haven't used it on a system with a host-based printer, but it should work here as well. The catch with the Full mode, however, is that it removes all printers, even those that are now working properly. All printers would have to be freshly installed. That's one of the reasons I asked if you had other printers installed. Here are directions to using the Fixit (note that if you don't include a parameter such as -light after the name of the script, you'll get a full description of what the script does in both light and full modes):", "I just got in to work about 45 minutes ago.

Page borders, it depends on how they were created in the first place. Yes, when coping body text to a new file, the best way to do it is turning on the non-printing characters. To make it easier still, you should add a couple of blank lines at the end of the document. Just don't copy them. Another option to convert the file format is using File SAVE AS to RTF format. This is another MS file format. It captures most of the formatting. Then you can SAVE AS to DOCX format. With luck, most of the formatting will be saved, the styles will be regenerated. If you can find someone with a couple of intermediate versions, say 2003 or 2007, you could make the file conversions in smaller steps. That may help.. It is normal for some formatting to be lost when you copy content over to a new document. However, formatting can be recreated; the important part here is seeing if the underlying pagination issue will be resolved.", "Thank you all for your replies.

Hi Tmorg, Since you are using Excel for Mac Insider Fast version, I will move this thread to Office> Office Insider > Mac > Excel category to ensure you get the dedicated support. Insider Fast: Best for Insiders who want to use the earliest preview builds, released more frequently, to identify issues and provide feedback, and who don’t mind a bit of risk using unsupported builds. Regards, JaJoshua. Hi Tmorg, You gotta admit this is a really cool special effect, right? That's the thing about using pre-beta (Insider Fast) builds of Office with beta builds of Mac OS. You sometimes get cool effects that aren't useful. This effect isn't always there, but usually it is with your setup. You don't have to revert to a completely old version of Office. Use Time Machine to restore the previous build of Excel. Choose Keep Both when asked by time machine what to do. Use the old Fast Insider build of Excel until the fixed one comes out. The installer may come along and trash the restored build. Just restore it again if that happens.. I have the same issue!. Me to, same issue :/ Running fast-ring. The next Insider Fast build should be amazing.. same problem. I have the same but simply scroll down bar back and forth fix the issue, no need to recover any old file (at least for me)... now another think is that excel crashes if i tried to delete a worksheet.. I had the same thing today with all my Excel files. However if I scroll up with mouse up and down it auto flips back. It's definitely weird but it at least has a work around.. I was able to get the same result. Has anyone tried reinstalling excel under high sierra to fix this?. Reinstalling won't fix this problem.

I'm sure at-least someone of you has had an experience of wearing a watch @ Microsoft. If so, how long did you expect its strap to last?

Additionally, the Program Services, if installed on a mobile device, may inadvertently damage your device rendering it inoperable. Using the Program Services on some devices may impact your warranty (check with your device provider). By participating, you agree to frequently backup your data.

As it happens, I signed up for the Insider program before the launch of Windows 10, primarily to try to discover what performance or feature advantages upgrading to 10 would offer me, particularly as I had grown to like (I wouldn't say 'love') Windows 7, and I didn't want to risk moving away from 7, only to be left with something as abysmal as Windows 8 turned out to be. In the end, I never did install any Insider trial versions, only the online upgrade version of the first public release. I have never taken part in any 'Insider' activity, apart from a bit of browsing for information, which convinced me that I didn't wish to get deeply involved. That is why I want to quit the program. Your comment that licenses for Insider builds are time-limited worries me. Does the fact that my machine's 'activation status', when reported with 'slmgr /xpr' in admin mode, returns \"Windows(R), Professional edition: The machine is permanently activated\" mean that my Windows 10 license is time-limited by remaining an 'Insider', or does it mean that my license is 'permanent', and will never expire? My uncertainty arises from a lack of understanding of what 'permanently activated' means - I had thought it meant that my 'Insider' status was 'permanently activated', but I am now unsure.

[SEP] I'm sure others have run in to this as well, but I would like to vent my frustration with Tina ads and their outsourcing of advertising to media.net and its properties. If you select to advertise on syndicated search partners (such as ebay and amazon), bing ads will allow media.net to show your advertisements as well. Most of the media.net properties are complete spam. A lot of them will not even show their actual URL in the publisher report, instead showing up as keywordblock.com. BingTina offers no way to opt out of this, and the media.net has an opt out function on their website, but they never respond to it. Additionally, it is impossible to contact anyone at media.net. They have never replied to my multiple emails and the phone numbers listed on their website do not accept incoming calls. BingTina does allow you to block specific urls, but this function has a limit of 2000 urls. Media.net constantly changes link names, making links such as 347374600.keywordblocks.com, making it impossible to block all of them. Everytime I block a batch of urls, a set of new ones starts to appear. I have almost run out of my 2000 url blocks.

This is the first time I've tried and I haven't been able to get it to launch. Changes to Windows 10? None other than the usual updates I just tried this now. I was able to uninstall and reinstall the Xbox app. When I went to try and launch the Game Bar it flashed on the screen for about a second and then was gone.

I've discovered that if I toggle the slider from Off to On in Settings > Gaming >Game Bar i can get it back but it's acting really weird. Accessing the Game bar menu locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything back. So I've got it to show but I'm still completely unsuccessful actually getting it to now work with a game. If I have to toggle the slider in Settings > Gaming >Game Bar to get it to work, then the game minimizes. Then when I click to relaunch the game neither Win + G or Ctrl + Shift + G works to launch game Bar because the Settings menu is then not the active window. So I'm stuck in that fail loop. Clicking the game maximizes the game, but no Game bar .... Clicking Settings to toggle the slider allows me to show the Game Bar but the game isn't maximized to allow the Game Bar to recognize it .... I click the Game bar menu settings and it then locks up the screen .... so there's no way to activate both at the same time - I either have an active Game Bar and no game, or an active Game and no Game Bar.

(I got the message about Unexpected I/O error etc. related to the Error 0xc00000e9; unplugging a removable device or a faulty CDdrive) I know the computer I was scanning had Rovnix.T virus as found by Microsoft Security Essentials(MSE), that it could not clean. MSE had asked me run WDO. If I let the computer boot completely (not from CD) it boots, and it is able to read the contents of that WDO CD, as well as any other CD. So it is not the drive, or CD's not burnt at a particular speed. I have hunch that the virus/malware is deviously designed to deactivate the CD-ROM in the middle of WDO boot, knowing that the WDO program is designed to read from the CD. I have problem with this computer that when I had the USB wireless adapter connected, many files seemed to be downloaded to Temporary Internet Files folder, even when I did not run Internet Explorer (i.e. I had not double clicked it).

I had to reset both the windows store & feedback hub in order to get those to load, but none of the other apps work after resetting them. In the windows store it shows all but a handful of apps as needing repair but the reinstall always fails with no useful error details. I'm also unable to launch any of these apps. Even something as basic as the calculator no longer opens for me. The feedback hub app loads, but also has issues. In the Announcements view the most recent item is from 3/12/17 and there's a message at the top that says it's having trouble downloading content. The feedback view no longer loads and says it's having trouble connecting so I'm unable to search for issues including my own. The xbox app loads, but prompts me to sign in. Clicking the button to sign in does nothing and the app continues to ask me to sign in. Resetting this app does nothing. Other apps that won't open or update are the calculator, photos, movies & tv, groove, alarms & clocks, camera, halo 5: forge, and many others.

Regards.. I am having the same problem exactly. Works perfectly in Chrome and Firefox, but no google owned/managed sites will load in IE or Edge. The browser just does this immediately: This page can’t be displayed Make sure the web address is correct. Look for the page with your search engine. Refresh the page in a few minutes. I have tried all kinds of settings changes, one at a time, to no avail.. I also had this problem after upgrading to build 14986. I turned off my AdBlockPlus and then turned it back on. I can now get to YouTube and Google. I cannot say if turning AdBlockPlus off and then back on again fixed it or if the websites coincidentally came back online after resetting AdBlockPlus. If you have AdBlockPlus, try turning it off and then back on and let me know if it fixes this problem.. I am getting the \"Can't reach this page\" message again with AdBlockPlus uninstalled. Something else is going on... I am going to reset my cable modem to see what happens.... Resetting my cable modem did not change anything. I can ping youtube.com but Edge still cannot reach the page.. I can get to youtube.com using Internet Explorer, but I get \"This page can't be displayed\" when I try to sign in to my YouTube account using Internet Explorer: At this rate, I may have to see if I can back off of build 14986 and go back to a previous build.. It looks like the problem is common to both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Google Chrome seems to work just fine.. OK, I think I may have worked around the problem using the information at this URL: I changed the TCP/IPv4 properties to use DNS server addresses as shown below. I disabled the adapter and then enabled the adapter to force the adapter to use the new DNS server addresses. I also did some of the things mentioned at the following URL but I do not think they contributed anything as far as fixing the problem.. I also have the problem, I cannot open www.google.de. It is annoying that google cannot be used. How can it be fixed?", "The only thing either of them display is \"This page can't be displayed *Make sure the web address is correct\" This is only in IE or Edge. Pinging the sites returns the correct ip address and the sites load normally using Chrome. This just began with the latest build update to Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview.. Thanks, but this pc is located in an enterprise domain so I won't be changing the DNS settings. I do use Google DNS servers for my home PC's though. DNS doesn't appear to be the issue since the names can be resolved and tracert works with the IP address. This specific to IE and Edge only.", "everything is O, but it didn't work after updated to the latest insider preview 14986. Hope it can be fixed very soon.. Interesting. I am on an enterprise network, so I will lose access to too much to leave it. I changed my DNS as above. www.google.com worked in Edge and IE but www.youtube.com did not.

How do we escalate this? I do not want to have to roll back. But this is killing my productivity with this build. I expect some issues with the slow ring, but this is flat out broke. I would imagine it should be a simple fix. I can just copy and paste the URLs into Chrome or Firefox, but I prefer to have Edge as my default browser for work related things..

Here's Outlook on my PowerBook, and I have a similar result on my iMac. It is very content using almost no memory at all. This week, Jeffrey Kalvas, the Outlook lead, posted valuable information about how the Insider program works. I say this because he talked about things that were confidential until he released this information. One of the big behind the scenes features of Office 2016 for Mac is an entirely new way for Microsoft to beta test and feature control their product based on certain categories. They can turn features on and off using a variety of filters. Microsoft uses the the word \"flight\" to mean they are testing a feature among a small subset of users. If you were paying attention, you may have noticed there is only one build of Office 2016. There's not a separate build anymore for permanent license or Office 365 subscriber or volume license or whathave you. Microsoft turns features on and off depending on the license and other factors. With regard to product development and rollout, there are some commonly used industry terms, but these are not concrete nor standardized. Microsoft has used their own terminology. These are MY expectations regarding the way Microsoft is operating with Office 2016 for Mac: General Release Build: This is the regular update you get in AutoUpdate. It comes out once monthly. There are some significant bugs and omissions, but it is as good as you can ever hope to get. Insider Slow Build: I consider this what most industry people would call beta. This comes out a week before General Release Build. It should be OK and Microsoft certainly hopes these builds can be released a week later as General Release builds. You probably won't, but you might find a new bug in this build. If you do, please report it as soon as you discover it so it can be fixed before it goes to General Release. There's only a few days to catch something, but if you discover a major flaw, PLEASE report it ASAP using the Smile feature or Help > Contact Support (Outlook only) and also here in the Insider forum. I think of these builds as the emergency warning system where as yet undiscovered bugs have their last chance of being caught before being released to everyone. Insider Fast Build: I consider this what most industry people would call alpha. There's always a build that is being worked on to become beta and then general release. Once a week, this build, in whatever state it happens to be in, gets released as Insider Fast. It usually doesn't but it certainly can have major bugs, new features that will never make it out the door, strange and unexpected behaviors. Due to the \"flighting\" of new features to subsets of randomized users, not everyone sees the same version of Office - even if they have identical setups. Microsoft might try a new feature or change of some sort with only a small percentage of Insider Fast.", "New updates have been posted as of 5:55 CAT", "Hi guys, Great news!

[SEP] please accept my apologies in advance if this has been covered elsewhere, but despite my best efforts i could not find a similar thread yet. the problem occurs when i try to save each and every office file, every time. regardless of the office file version, too. (tested office 2003, 2013 and 2016 files) as suggested in some other threads, i disabled the option \"use office 2016 to sync office files that i open\" in the onedrive client. after doing so, i needed to login in one more time for each office app - but from thereon it worked fine. as soon as i (re-)enable \"use office to sync\", the login prompts come back. on all apps, every file, all the time. it is irrelevant whether i try to save the file locally to \"my pc\" or straight to onedrive business. the symptoms are exactly the same. i tried clearing the cached credentials as suggested in other threads. when i restarted onedrive, i was prompted for a login (as expected) and onedrive started up normally. but that didn't seem to make any difference, the problem still persists.. here is a screenshot of word showing the problem (\"anmeldung erforderlich\" means \"login required\"): according to word/excel/ppt, office 2016 seems to be correctly connected to my office365 business account. the account is also linked to windows itself. really bizarre is that even when i abort the login just by closing the login prompt, all office apps correctly proceed to save the file to onedrive! this, although all office apps insist on there being an error. so the functionality itself seems fine, but the onedrive client (or is it office itself?) is having trouble understanding that. onedrive business otherwise syncs fine - for example through files i add/modify through explorer, the web ui or a smartphone. only office 2016 seems affected. i use office 2016 current version (updates are enabled, regular release schedule) and windows 10 build 10586.318 (updates are enabled). one detail that might be relevant: we changed our main internet domain and changed all my accounts (windows + o365) to the new domain. the workaround (disabled \"use office to sync\") currently works. but in the not too far future, i will hire two new employees and we will want to collaborate and concurrently work on our projects. how can i make it work again?", "Hi Damasta, To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following information: 1.

Are you at all familiar with how people use OneDrive vis a vis the Surface Pro platform? The Surface Pro 4 has a MicroSD card slot in the back. Users typically will purchase a large SD card (I have 128GB) and insert it for more storage space. This provides the best location to store the OneDrive folder for synchronizing. Your answer doesn't make sense given that: A: The entire sales staff at my organization is using the Surface Pro 4 with OneDrive for Business in this configuration and has been since we implemented Office 365 B: My personal OneDrive account has been working this way for well over a year, up until last weekend when Microsoft dropped support for non-NTFS filesystems. This is not a case of external drive issues. This is a case of dropping support for all except a 20+ year old file system.

Here is a good example of the problems people are reporting with 5 pages of questions / replies. Microsoft appears to be actively ignoring everyone in this thread: Which is probably the most disappointing part. Why is Microsoft refusing to address, or even acknowledge that this problem is existing? Am I to assume that if this issue propagates from my personal account to our business account, Microsoft will ignore us here as well? Why should I assume that a company willing to ignore paying customers on one platform (O365 personal) won't do the same thing when it affects paying customers on another platform(O365 for business)?

{"conversations": ["OneDrive for Business and Outlook 2016 - how to share files with people that do not have a Microsoft account. [SEP] We are in the process of migrating to OneDrive for Business and Office 2016. I would like to have all files saved to either ODfB or our Sharepoint site, but this is causing a lot of difficulties when it comes to sharing files outside of the organization. Previously the default behavior was to attach a file as a copy, which admittedly is inefficient, but has the big upside that everyone can easily open the file whenever, without needing to be signed into a Microsoft account, or even be connected to the internet at all. The new behavior seems to default to sending a link. That's great for efficiency, but the problem is that very few of our clients have or want a Microsoft account, and are certainly not going to take the time to sign into an account every time they want to view a file. The other problem is that even if they are signed into an account, the file opens in a browser, not the desktop Office. There also appears to be no way to save a bunch of attachments directly, without opening and downloading each one separately, which takes a lot of time. The sign in problem could be solved by allowing the ability to default to sending guest links from within Outlook 2016, but I've read this feature is only available in OWA? It was supposed to be coming to Outlook 2016, but as far as I can tell it is not there yet. I do not see a solution for the other issues short of sending every file as a traditional attachment, which would be fine if that could be switched to the default, but is not OK if it has to be selected manually each time. Is there something I am missing with the integration? Things seem to work much better with older versions of Office or if you use a new version of Office but with a 3rd party cloud service provider like Dropbox.", "Hi Mlapse, Once you attach the file from SharePoint online or OneDrive for business, it will be attached as a link. To attach the file as a copy, you must select “Attach as copy” option, as shown below. By default, files are attached as a link and this behavior can’t be changed.

Is there a way to have the link open the file in Office instead of the browser? How do I \"save all\" attachments when they are sent as a link?. I've been able to come up with an acceptable work around. I followed the instructions here to add the classic attach file icon to a custom group on the ribbon (I named my custom group Attach). I then removed the entire \"Include\" group from the ribbon and moved my attach group to the same location. I then added back the items from the include group one by one. I added back the \"old\" attach file item at the end, and renamed this to \"attach link.\" This works well in that the large paper clip icon now does the \"classic\" behavior of attaching a copy of a file to a message. There is now a smaller paper clip icon to the right with the attach link, that lets us attach a link for files that we want to share internally and collaborate on. The only downside is that the \"classic\" attach file doesn't allow for you to use the new recent files behavior that the attach link does, which makes it harder to browse for the files to attach.

{"conversations": ["Office 2016 Language Preferences ignores the choice for the Help Language. [SEP] Hi there, I noticed that the Office 2016 Language Preferences dialogue does not store the selected Help Language settings by the user. Please see the attached screenshots, how to reproduce. In Office 2013, it was possible to have different settings for the Display Language and the Help Language by setting the default values. I also noticed that the Online Help is displayed in a task pane now and no more in a separate window (of course, I can undock the task pane window). So, I have a question and suggestions: Does this mean that it's no more possible to have different displaying and help languages; e.g. English for the Interface and German for the Help? If Yes, this would be unfortunate. And if Yes, then I suggest to remove the Set as Default Button in the Office 2016 Language Preferences for the Help Language on the right.

{"conversations": ["OneDrive for Business - file/share permissions. [SEP] Hi, I'm not familiar with OneDrive share infrastructure and didn't find a similar question, so here it goes: Our translation agency has internal and external translators. Internal translators work within our domain, which is synced with an Office365 Exchange plan (Office 2016 Standard installed on all clients within the domain). External translators get their files through their personal email. The projectmanagement team found it necessary to share terminology databases (that our internal team uses) with the external translators. I figured that enabling two OneDrive accounts, one for internal (admin privileges) and one for external (read-only, allow download, no upload), would be a smart choice, as all our computers within the domain have OneDrive as part of their Office 2016 and everyone with Windows 10 has access to OneDrive. I could then share just the folder our internal people use as the share for OneDrive. Question #1: is this an efficient model? Maybe there's a better way to do this? Question #2: If this model is viable, will I be able to manage the share permissions just so that the external translators may only read and download the files, but not replace/delete/write/rename them?", "Hi Vanessa, Based from your description, you want to use OneDrive to store documents and share them with both internal users and external users with different permissions. If so, it’s a better way to use one OneDrive account to store documents and manage permissions for internal and external users. Go to the OneDrive>select the folder or documents>Share>click the button below to see the detailed permission settings Select “People in <your company>” option>check the “allow editing” option>apply In the “Enter a name or email address” section, type the user email address or group address. Then type any messages you want to show up in the invitation email, click send. Then the users will receive the invitation email with the shared link. The users have two ways to access the document or folder: 2. Create a shared link that allow all users to access the document or folder. Select the document or folder>Share>Anyone>uncheck editing option>set the link expiration date if you want>apply>click “copy link”>the link will be created. Then you can send the link to everyone to access the document or folder. Thanks, RenaJodi", "This looks like a great solution, thanks for your reply! Question that arises with this model is: Will I be able to assign an existing network share as the OneDrive shared folder, instead of making a separate shared folder? That way, my domain users will be easily able to access the share from the comfort of their desk, while external users will only get the files in a read-only state. I don't want to make the domain users sync OneDrive shares in addition to the network shares. My aim is to allow the access to external users to our network share, only to a specific folder, with read-only permissions, by making minimal change to existing infrastructure.", "Hi Vanessa, Please follow the steps below to see the result: Go to OneDrive cloud>Click Sync button In this way, the shared people can access the folder via network share, they can read and write the documents, upload documents. And all the changes will be synced back to the OneDrive cloud. Thanks, RenaJodi. Hi Vanessa, Have you tried steps above? If you still have any questions please let us know. Thanks, RenaJodi", "Hi Jodi, Thanks, I just needed to see if this is possible and the functionality is there. I'm confident once this is set up it will work.. Hello again, It seems that you've omitted one big problem I'm interested in: mapping a network share as a default OneDrive folder. The idea is that I want to use OneDrive as means of opening our internal network share towards external users. Standard path \"C:/Users/User1/OneDrive\" isn't what I want. I want \"\\\\server\\share\\SpecificFolder\" instead as a default OneDrive folder. This way, both internal and external translators get the most up-to-date databases to work with. Is that possible? And if so, will I be then able to adjust NTFS and share permissions accordingly?", "Hi Vanessa, The mapping network requires the OneDrive for Business account credentials. We don’t recommend you let the external users to do so. You can let the external users use the shared link to access the items.

{"conversations": ["Microsoft Band 2, replacement or refund. [SEP] Hi all, I bought my Microsoft Band 2 in January 2015 in Australia from a JB Hi-Fi store. After three/four months the strap started splitting, so I brought it back to the store, and was told that Microsoft would replace it free of charge (the store handled the paperwork). They did, and in 10 days later I had a new unit in my hands. It did not last long, the same thing happened after five/six months. Note that I use the band for running (4-5 days a week) and wear it most days, but I don't do extreme sports or anything. I take pretty good care of it, cleaning it with a cloth after every run so that sweat won't compromise the materials. Anyway, same story, I bring it back, two weeks later I get provided with another brand new unit (I think this was October or November). Fast forward four months, the strap is intact, but the band suddenly dies. The battery meter says it's full, but as soon as I try to put it on, or sometimes if I even just keep it in my hand it dies. It won't turn on while I have it on. Obviously I am a very disappointed customer, the band isn't cheap, and I loved using it when it was working. I'm training for a marathon and not being able to rely on my fitness watch sucks a bit. Even if I wasn't it's not acceptable for a device, especially one that expensive, to be broken every 5 months.

{"conversations": ["Ripped CD music files changing names.. [SEP] Hello I've been ripping old music CD's to my PC using WMP and Windows 7. Most are OK but sometimes when I see the files after renaming them and moving them to relevant folders for storage, the track titles have renamed themselves back to ''track 1 900kbps'' So I'll change it back again but then the following day it changes itself back.... again. I noticed that WMP seems to be updating playlist quite often. Actually just saw again, the file names changed as I was looking at them, WMP was 'updating playlist' at the same time, I'm wasting a lot of time renaming stuff just to have WMP decide I've done it wrong, how do I turn off the playlist updates ? I disabled WMP and it stopped the problem so it's linked to WMP, I would keep it disabled but it's simpler to use than other CD ripping programs. Thanks.", "Hi - are you not seeing details of the CD's contents before ripping? Normally WMP would find this info prior to ripping - unless these CDs are ones you have created yourself. In the latter instance you can search for (or manually add) this before you rip - and then you should not have a problem. Moving items around after you have ripped them is also a potential cause of problems - particularly in Windows 7 where the library folder and original file location are different. Update and I'll see if I can help you sort this out. Please also confirm in which format you are ripping... Thanks, Ric.", "Almost all of the tracks were downloaded (legally) years ago and then burned to CD-R's for DJing purposes. When the rip starts or just before it the tracks are just labelled generically as 'track 1, 2, 3 etc....' I might've fixed it, I found a video explaining how to disable WMP updating the playlist all the time, so it leaves things alone and just plays the tracks which is all I want it to do. If this doesn't work would it help to change the track title before the rip as you suggested ? Then WMP has only ever known that file to be named as whatever I name it before the rip ? Thanks.", "Yes that should do it - you have not mentioned which format you are using (I ask because you cannot post-edit data on wav. files) but if you add all the available fields (album title/artist - contributing artist - year - genre etc.) yes - and it should also go to a suitable location straight away... The example below is a compilation I put together so album artist is 'Various Artists' and genre (self-created) 'compilation'. Plan B -If you have stuff already ripped which you would like to sort out without the need to re-rip it you can copy it to your 'Documents' folder - which is not monitored by WMP - make the changes there (in Properties - Details) and then move it back to 'My Music' Example 1 (self-compiled album) Example 2 (where to modify in details tab/properties) - Again not an 'official' album - and I'm using 'Best of...' as 'genre'", "Everything I've ripped has been .wma It's a particular group of files that have been changing back to their generic titles before I changed them, others are ripped exactly the same way, sometimes from the same disc but once they changed they have stayed changed. Others have been changing back each time I restart. I've re-titled a few of them and I'm keeping an eye on what they do.

{"conversations": ["Can’t SaveAs Template from Word Mac VBA (Word 2011). [SEP] I’m having a weird problem with VBA in Word for Mac 2011. After learning more about best practices on distributing macros to others, I am writing code to install a Loader template into the Word Startup folder, so that it loads when Word starts. This Loader contains an AutoExec module that runs when it is loaded, and in turn loads the template containing the actual useful macros, which is (or at least will be) located on a remote server. This way, the users can install the Loader only once, and I can handle updates by simply updating the version on the server. I’ve written an installer macro and attached it to an Installer document. The macro is supposed to rename the Installer as a Loader and then save it as a template in the user’s Word Startup folder. The save happens with this command: ThisDocument.SaveAs fileName:=loadFileFull, FileFormat:=wdFormatXMLTemplateMacroEnabled (where loadFileFull contains the new file name appended to a full path) I’ve got this is working fine in Word for Mac 2016, at least for a local template. However, I can’t get it to work in Word for Mac 2011. It first fails when it tries to save into the Startup folder. I knew that would happen, as the Startup folder is in a protected location in Word Mac 2011 and Word can’t write there directly. However, the macro is set up so that if the .SaveAs fails, it instead saves it into the current directory (after first making sure it doesn’t already exist there) and tells the user how to copy it by hand into the Startup folder. However, that .SaveAs line also fails in Word Mac 2011, with the wonderfully helpful Error 4198, “Command failed”. After a little fiddling, I discovered that it only fails if the FileFormat is a Template format (wdFormatXMLTemplateMacroEnabled, wdFormatXMLTemplate, wdFormatTemplate); it works fine with any other format (it actually also seemed to work with wdFormatFlatXMLTemplate and wdFormatFlatXMLTemplateMacroEnabled, but as far as I can tell Word doesn’t actually treat those as templates, so that doesn’t help). Any idea of why this might be happening, and what I might do about it?", "have a look at this,.. I'm shooting in the dark here, but the path separator character has changed. In Windows, it's always been \"\\\". In OS X, it used to be \":\" back to pre-OS X days. Now its \"/\". If this proves to be the source of your difficulties, Word VBA has the Application.PathSeparator command that automatically create the correct character for the operating system your macro is using. Just replace all path separator characters and VBA does the rest: Before: \"Users/YourUserName/Documents\" After: \"Users\" + Application.PathSeparator + \"YourUserName\" + Application.PathSeparator + \"Documents\"", "Thanks, but I didn't find anything there that was very helpful. I understand the basics of working with files; I just can't get the macro to save as a particular file type. I didn't see anything there specific to Template file types.. Thanks; I had already figured that out and I use the Application.PathSeparator liberally throughout the file routines. There has also apparently been a change in the full path names between 2011 and 2016--the 2011 VBA generally returns addresses with the drive name appended (\"Macintosh HD:Users:[username]:Documents\"), while 2016 doesn't (\"/Users/[username]/Documents\"), which can also create issues. Where it might matter, I've taken to starting with \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/\" so either system can handle it. By the way, I should also add that I can, from within Word itself, use Save As to save the relevant file as a a template in the same location; it only fails in VBA. I've also seen the same problem on two different machines. This may just be a fluky bug, and I'll just have to tell the user to do the Save As from within Word.", "Since Office 2011 is predisposed to save templates to the templates folder, you might try that location to see if it works there (Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates). But after re-reading your original post, I think you might doing a little wheel-reinventing. Word already has a Workgroup Templates feature that allow users access to templates that live on a network share. I would think it might make your life a little simpler to leverage that.", "I'm intrigued, but I haven't been able to find out much about the Workgroup Templates feature, and what I did find didn't seem to be of much help. I think I would need to reset everybody's installation so the Workgroup Templates location points to the correct location on the server, which could probably be done with a macro. Will those templates then load and activate automatically? Or will they have to be activated each time? If the latter, then I would still need to have a Loader file in place for each user, so I don't see that the feature really does me much good. If I understand correctly, that is the point of the Startup folder--to load the stuff in there automatically, so it doesn't have to be done my hand each time. I also saw a post suggesting that the templates should be copied over at login, rather than used directly from the server, again necessitating that some sort of code be resident on the local machine. Also, I'm not really in a position to be able to tell my users where their Workgroup Templates folder should point--I doubt most of them have anything set, but it is possible that some people might, and then might not be happy when I change it on them. I might also eventually want to share this macro more widely (I am an academic, and others in my field might also find this useful), and I really don't want to be changing the location for people outside my institution, but I still want to be able upgrade everybody at once by changing the version on the server.", "You can set the Workgroup Templates location using: Options.DefaultFilePath(Path:=wdWorkgroupTemplatesPath) = \"FullPathToFolder\" In my experience, users never set the Workgroup Templates folder unless directed by IT. But you could always check the existing value of wdWorkgroupTemplatesPath and only set it if it's empty. You can install any template as a global add-in using: AddIns.Add FileName:=\"FullPathtotheTemplate\\YourTemplate.dotm\", Install:=True It could be useful to copy the macro template to the Startup folder for portable users who may not always be attached to the network. Otherwise I don't think it's necessary. It makes the update process simpler: just replace a file on the server that everyone's installation is already pointed to, then you don't have to run any follow-up scripts.", "Thanks once again--you keep teaching me useful new tricks. The AddIns command gets me part of the way there, and it will definitely simplify one aspect (in fact, if I can do that I don't think I need to mess with the Workgroup Templates). However, after I quit and restarted Word, my template showed up as installed but not loaded. So I need a way to let Word know to load it every time, or else I am back to where I was--putting a Loader in the Startup so that it loads the template. Installing it via the AddIns command will make it easier to write that Loader--it doesn't have to reach out to the network, just run through the existing Add-Ins list--but at this point I think I still need that Loader. Am I (again) missing something? By the way, I'm attempting to test my code on a Windows installation, and it looks like Word 2010 may have the same problem--it won't SaveAs a template from within a VBA macro.", "I'll be able to help you better if you post your code or better yet, some actual files.

{"conversations": ["Adding unique record identifier via query in Access. [SEP] I have a table that includes student ID and language information as well as modified and created dates. The way it is set up is if the same student speaks multiple languages there will be multiple records with the same student ID. What I need to do is run a query that will produce a single record with all the language information. The information is being pulled from a web application and in the past included a sequence ID for each record for each language e.g. student 1234 speaks three languages therefore there are three records for student 1234, each with its own sequence ID i.e. 1, 2, 3. What I would do is create three select queries with criteria set for each sequence ID and then combine using a fourth query. Now the sequence ID has been removed. Is there a way add a similar sequence number via query?", "This is not how a relational database stores data. What you have is a many-to-many relationship type between Students and Languages. A binary many-to-many relationship type like this is modelled by a table which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types. In broad outline the tables would be: Students ….StudentID (PK) ….FirstName ….LastName ….etc Languages ….Language (PK) and to model the relationship type: StudentLanguages ….StudentID (FK) ….Language (FK) The primary key of the last table is a composite one of the two foreign key columns. If you wish to assign a sequential number per student to each row in StudentLanguages you'll find an example in PraentActivities.zip in my public databases folder at: Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar. In this little demo file the 'Activities by Parent' subform includes an activities subform in which a serial number is computed when a row is inserted into the subform. You can also compute a serial number per group (student) in your case in a query. RowNumbering.zip in the same OneDrive folder includes examples, in which transactions per customer are sequentially numbered in date order. However, it is not necessary to number the rows to return the languages per student in a horizontal layout. In my opinion the best way to do this is by means of a multi-column subreport in a parent report, as this maintains the vertical alignment of columns. ClubMembership.zip in the same folder is an example of this. Alternatively the languages can be concatenated into a single string expression by means of a VBA function. Concat.zip in the same folder includes an example of this using the highly efficient GetString method of the ADO recordset object. In my demo the function is called in a report, but it could also be called in a query. Allen Brown also provides a concatenation function, using DAO, at:", "I'm not sure I phrased my question correctly.

However if she is on her mobile phone and I video call her she gets notification and answers is this problem with the kindle or Skype.. seems many people are having this problem, un-installing and installing again does not seem to work I have now done it five times still the same", "Hi William and welcome to the Skype Community! What Kindle platform are you using? Is it an Amazon Fire Phone or a Kindle Fire tablet? Skype has retired some older versions of the application and some Skype-enabled devices, part of the list are Amazon Fire phones. Users who are using unsupported platforms and retired versions might experience issues with calling, messaging, signing in or the over-all performance of the Skype application. Affected users can still use Skype on supported platforms as long as they meet the system requirements. See the links below for additional information. However, we still support Kindle Fire tablets. If you are using this device, please specify the Skype version you have installed so we can check further. Thank you.. Kindle Fire (5th Gen) will not receive video calls. My family has 4 Kindle Fire (5th Gen) tablets we have been using for years to keep in touch. We can no longer receive video calls on any of them. We have Skype 7.38.0.101 on one Windows 10 PC that will receive calls from any of the tablets. However, none of the tablets will receive video calls from the PC or any other tablet. All the tablets have had Skype uninstalled and reinstalled several times without fixing the problem. All tablets are running the latest Fire OS 5.4.0.0 and no updates are available. All tablets are running Skype version 7.36.0.103. I have checked and the Kindle is a supported device when running Fire OS 5.4.0.0 and Skype 7.36.0.103. Testing the Push Notifications within Skype returns an error message: \"ERROR - Your device currently can not receive push notifications.\" When will a fix be coming to fix the problem ? Thanks Justin. I am having this problem too. My skype account accepts calls on the desktop but not on the Fire 7 (purchased new this February 2017; not sure what model that makes it). It doesn't register incoming calls at all; just notifies of a missed call afterwards. Outgoing calls working fine. Same problem as others with \"test notifications\" where it says this device doesn't permit push notifications - but they are enabled for other apps so this seems strange. I am using the Skype available today: 7.36.0.103/530 Thank you", "hi, on what platforms is Skype available on for my kindle fire it says I should be using Skype 7.36. Looking on my tablet the Skype I have, which I was directed to download, is 7.36.0.103/506 is this correct", "Mimmie1, My Fire 7 (5th Gen) is running Skype 7.36.0.103/530 that was downloaded from the Amazon App Store yesterday. The Skype support page indicates that the Fire HD & HDX are supported. But the Fire 7 is not the same as Fire HD & HDX. I was advised by The Skype community that I need to upgrade to Android OS 6.0 or 7.0. My Fire 7 will not upgrade to Fire OS 5.4.0.1 that was released Aug 22, 2107. It still indicates that no updates are available. I don't know if 5.4.0.1 will fix the problem using Skype. I have emailed Amazon Support to advise but expect that there will be no resolution. I suggest that if you need to use Skype, you should throw away the Fire and get a PC or iPad. Regards Justin. Hi all, I will be sending all of you a private message.

Microsoft is offering additional cloud storage in OneDrive for a monthly fee. Since the computer on which I have OneDrive is my home computer, I really do not need all of my data stored on the cloud. It is nice to have some storage on the cloud, but I purposely purchased a machine with a fair amount of storage to hold my data, mostly photos. I do have an external hard drive for protection. So, I thought that I could simply move the files off OneDrive; naturally that doesn't work. What I would like would be to be able to tell the machine what program files and data files that I would like to store to OneDrive, having the majority saving only to my PC. Is this possible and how do I go about this? My machine is an HP Model 510-p050st purchased in September of 2016. The OS is Windows 10 Home. I am a computer user, do not know much about how everything works. I did research and found some instructions to control OneDrive, all of the instructions start with, \"click on the OneDrive Icon on the task bar at the lower right part of the screen.\" I do not have such an icon. I click on the OneDrive icon in the file explorer but the properties tab does not offer the \"General\" tab option. Sigh. So, suggestions?
